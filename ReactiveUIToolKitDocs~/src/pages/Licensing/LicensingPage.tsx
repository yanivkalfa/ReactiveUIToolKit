      <strong>ReactiveUI is free for almost everyone.</strong> If you're a student, a hobbyist, a
      jam team, or an indie studio earning under <strong>$250,000 a year</strong> — everything on
      this page reduces to: <em>use it, ship your game, credit "Made with ReactiveUI", pay
      nothing.</em>

      Am I free?

    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      <strong>Learning, prototyping, game jams, unreleased projects</strong> — free, always, for
      everyone. Even a AAA studio evaluates and develops free; payment only ever applies to{' '}
      <em>shipping</em>.

      <strong>
        Your company (plus its parents/subsidiaries) earned under $250k in the last 12 months
      </strong>{' '}
      — free to ship, commercially, forever. No registration required, no strings beyond the
      credits line.

      <strong>Over $250k and shipping a product</strong> — you need a commercial license. That's

      The two asks we make of everyone
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      1. <strong>Credits.</strong> Put "Made with ReactiveUI" in your game's credits, wherever you
      credit other middleware. That line is how the project grows.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      2. <strong>Don't resell the library.</strong> You can ship anything you build <em>with</em>{' '}
      ReactiveUI; you can't repackage ReactiveUI itself as a competing UI framework. (Your game is
      never a "competing product" — this clause exists purely so nobody takes the source and sells
      it out from under the project.)

      Common questions
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" sx={Styles.question}>
      I downloaded an older version — do the new terms apply to me?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      No. Every copy keeps the terms it shipped with. The new license applies from{' '}
      <strong>0.10.0</strong> (Unity) onward — and from the matching releases of the Godot and
      Unreal libraries. (Old versions also stop receiving updates and support, so staying current
      is worth it anyway.)
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" sx={Styles.question}>
      We're a contractor building a game for a client — whose revenue counts?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      The entity that ships the product. If your client publishes the game, their revenue decides
      the tier; put the license in their name.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" sx={Styles.question}>
      We crossed $250k mid-project. Are we in trouble?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      No — you have a 60-day window to pick up a license, and nothing you did before crossing
      needs back-payment. The threshold looks at the 12 months before you ship.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" sx={Styles.question}>
      Does the free tier limit features?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      No. Same library, same features, same updates. The only difference is the piece of paper.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" sx={Styles.question}>
      We can't afford $2,000 but we're just over the threshold / we're a nonprofit / weird case?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      Email us — <a href="mailto:yanivkalfa@gmail.com">yanivkalfa@gmail.com</a>. We'd rather you
      ship with ReactiveUI than not.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body1" sx={Styles.question}>
      Can I support the project without owing anything?
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
      Yes, gladly — contributions and tips are always welcome, and shipping your game with a
      credits line (plus telling us about it) is already real support.
    </Typography>

    <Typography variant="body2" paragraph sx={Styles.section}>
