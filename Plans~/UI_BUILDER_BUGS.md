# RUITK Builder — Bug and Gap Register

Companion to `VISUAL_EDITOR_PLAN.md` (what to build) and `POC_PARITY_SPEC.md`
(what the web POC does). This file is the **defect register**: everything known
to be wrong, missing, fake, or undecided in the shipped builder.

Branch: `feat/ruitk-builder`. Every item has a stable `UB-##` id — reference
these in commits, never the line numbers, which move.

## How to use this file

- **Test fixture** for every item is the same tree the campaign has used
  throughout: `UitkxTestFileDoNotTouch.uitkx` and its 3 imported peers
  (4 files, ~11 graph nodes). "Reproduce" means: open that file in the
  builder and do the named gesture.
- An item is **CLOSED** only when it has been seen working on screen. "Code
  committed" is not closed — the campaign already burned a round on fixes that
  were committed, gated, and never rendered.

### Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OPEN` | Confirmed defect, not fixed. |
| `UNVERIFIED` | Fix committed, never confirmed on screen. |
| `DESIGN` | Blocked on a decision, not on code. See §8. |
| `CLOSED` | Seen working on screen. |
| `ACCEPTED` | Deliberate divergence, do not re-flag. |

## Campaign ledger — 2026-08-16 execution run

The whole register was implemented in eight waves on `feat/ruitk-builder`:
W1 `bf12c1d2` data truth · W2 `412392c1` directive head rows · W3 `7f591852`
canvas visuals · W4 `fa96ce16` drag machine · W5 `0a261394` editor
intelligence · W6 `777a9c3d` hook truth + loud preview · W7 `2ce57600` IDE
directive drift · W8 `580c32d9` the 41-agent adversarial review's 18 confirmed
fixes (its deferred tail is REMAINING_WORK UB-REV) · W9 `91182808` the owner's
field report: the Builder assembly had been CS0433-dead in Unity since W6 (the
editor-variant language DLL exported a second public HookRegistry — variant
now internal; the rsp smoke gate is blind to this class because it compiles
Shared from source, noted), five samples carried committed cp1252 mojibake
since the samples flatten (repaired), the source pane's C# body colours via
the LSP's Roslyn-merged semanticTokens/full with the local tokens as the
between-edits fallback, code islands share the same colouring passes, plus
the window-close NullReferenceException and the reload/mount log spam.
Gates on every wave:
validate-uitkx, SG-backed csc smoke, machine-path; W6/W7/W8 also SG 1879/1879
+ LSP 180/180 and committed-DLL rebuilds. Round-2 and round-3 captures
verified the visible surface on screen (round 3's style-card/panel-l2 frames
were invalid — the owner's browser held focus). The item texts below describe
the defects AS FOUND; current state lives here.

| Item | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| UB-01/02/03 | `CLOSED`(render) | round 3: `@if`/`@else`/`@foreach` head rows with indented children at L1 AND L2 (GalagaGame/GameScreen), badge colours per keyword; wrap/clause MENUS + moves remain interactive-unverified |
| UB-04 | `CLOSED` | suites pin the behavior; grammar/VSIX halves are presentation-only and ride the owner's next F5 |
| UB-05 | `PARTIAL` | source pane fully treated; the six inline canvas editors are deferred as REMAINING_WORK UB-05a |
| UB-06 | `UNVERIFIED` | T3 relay wired; needs a CS error seen in the pane |
| UB-07 | `CLOSED` | knownElements live — custom tags classify teal on screen (round 3), UITKX0105 armed |
| UB-08/09/10/11/13/14 | `UNVERIFIED` | menu/insertion content — popup menus are not capturable; verify by driving |
| UB-12 | `UNVERIFIED` | registry arity + truncation note |
| UB-15 | `UNVERIFIED` | loud preview failures (hook-module copy with real signature/consumers seen in round 3) |
| UB-20 | `CLOSED` | round-2: L0 leaves the pill's right edge, terminal dots on targets |
| UB-21 | `CLOSED` | premise corrected — palette already matched the POC; the custom-tag teal shipped in W5, seen in round 3 |
| UB-22 | `CLOSED` | round-2/3: dots paint in the overlay, no occlusion |
| UB-23 | `CLOSED` | round 3: GameScreen's long markup scrolls inside the capped section, card bounded |
| UB-24 | `UNVERIFIED` | typography was already POC-correct; the real fix was the 0.18→0.30 zoom floor (+ persisted-zoom clamp, W8) |
| UB-25 | `UNVERIFIED` | coloured edit overlay with auto-degrade (W8 fixed the restore-ordering bug); interactive check |
| UB-26 | `OPEN` | layout crowding shrank with the caps but long swoops remain; layout follow-up if the owner still minds |
| UB-30/31/32 | `UNVERIFIED` | drag machine is gesture-driven; owner drive-through (W8 added button filter, root backstop, canvas-scoped hit-test) |
| UB-40 | `CLOSED` | layer dropdown seen in rounds 2 and 3 |
| UB-50/51 | `UNVERIFIED` | carried from round 1; round 3's style-card frame was invalid |
| UB-60..66 | `UNVERIFIED` | interactive surfaces, review-only as before |
| UB-224 | `FIXED` | edit-session overwrite; snapshot now carries its file, 22 out-of-Unity checks |
| UB-225 | `FIXED` | library refreshes on every graph change, not only on mount |
| UB-226 | `UNVERIFIED` | union compile wired; owner saw the parent render its children unsaved, wants a clean run |
| UB-227 | `FIXED` | the union dropped every inlined companion; source and path now travel together |
| UB-228 | `FIXED` | module-static swap wrote to an arbitrary `hmr_` copy instead of the project type |
| UB-229 | `FIXED` | hot assembly names repeated after an HMR restart, so `LoadFrom` returned the previous session's assembly |

## 1. Coherence — is what the builder shows actually real?

The question this section answers: when the builder tells you something, is it
reading the real language services, or approximating? Anything approximate is a
lie the user will eventually act on.

### Ground truth: what the language actually implements

Established by reading `ide-extensions~/language-lib/Parser/UitkxParser.cs`
and `SourceGenerator~/Emitter/CSharpEmitter.cs`. Record it here because the
register below depends on it and because two IDE layers already disagree with
it (UB-04).

A directive is a **child block in markup**, and its body is **raw C# containing
`return (…)` statements** — not bare JSX:

```
@if (count >= 0) {
  return ( <Label text={$"ok {count}"} /> );
} @else {
  return ( <Label text="no" /> );
}
```

**Five constructs are implemented**, each lowered to an IIFE:

| Directive | Clauses | Binds | Lowers to | Yields |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@if` | `@else if` (unlimited), `@else` | — | `Func<VirtualNode>` with real `return`s | one node or `null` |
| `@for` | — | init var(s) | `Func<VirtualNode[]>`, returns rewritten to `__r.Add` | array |
| `@foreach` | — | loop var (header split on first `" in "`) | same | array |
| `@while` | — | — | same | array |
| `@switch` | `@case`, `@default` | — | `Func<VirtualNode>`, per-case brace scope | one node or `null` |

`@case` labels end at a single `:` (`::` preserved for `global::`).
`@break` is parsed but has **no AST node** — it is silently swallowed as an
optional `@switch` case terminator and is an error anywhere else.
`@continue` and `@code` are always errors. Unknown directives raise
**UITKX0305** (Error).

### UB-223 — a new tree renders another tree's components `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report: a brand-new, never-saved tree whose children are all empty
rendered text from a DIFFERENT tree. A child named `BlaOne` - a name existing
nowhere else - rendered nothing (correct). Children named `LeftSide` and
`RightSide`, which DO exist in a saved tree, rendered that tree's content.
Name-shaped behaviour out of a system whose keys are path-shaped.

Three hypotheses died against evidence before the right question was asked:
namespaces are distinct (every directory segment is used), family keys are
distinct AND parent and child agree on them, and `RefreshRuntime.GetFamily` is
an exact dictionary hit with no name fallback.

DIAGNOSED by the family-binding probe (Trace). It prints, per child reference,
the key the parent asked for and the declaring type + assembly of the body it
received:

```
family bindings for NewBla  (asm hmr_NewBla_7)
  asked for: ...__RuitkBuilderUnsaved___.NewBla.components.BlaOne.BlaOne.BlaOne
    got:     ...__RuitkBuilderUnsaved___.NewBla.components.BlaOne...  asm=hmr_BlaOne_4
  asked for: Ruitk.Uitkx.UI_Test.NewComponent.components.LeftSide.LeftSide.LeftSide
    got:     Ruitk.Uitkx.UI_Test.NewComponent.components.LeftSide...  asm=Assembly-CSharp
```

ROOT CAUSE (located, not yet fixed): **the registry is innocent - every lookup
returned exactly what was asked for. The parent asked for the wrong key.** The
importer sits at the provisional unsaved root, and its `./components/LeftSide/
LeftSide` specifier resolved to the SAVED tree's file instead of its own
sibling. `BlaOne` resolved correctly only because no saved file shares its name.

So component-child specifier resolution is not doing what the hook-family map
beside it already does: resolve relative to the IMPORTER and test existence
through the overlay (`UitkxSourceExists`) rather than the disk. Unsaved siblings
are not on disk by design - that is the save-only contract - so a disk-gated
existence check cannot see them and something falls back to a project-wide
lookup by name.

This is the same shape as UB-222: asking the DISK about a tree that only exists
in memory. The fix belongs at the resolution point, not at the render.
FIXED. `HmrCSharpEmitter.ResolveComponentFqn` took the first loaded type whose
SIMPLE name matched the tag, so a second tree with a `LeftSide` in it won.
The compiler now builds a bound-name -> component-FQN map from the IMPORTS -
resolved importer-relative, existence tested through `UitkxSourceExists` - and
the emitter prefers it. Names with no import still reach the assembly scan,
which is the one case it is right for (hand-written package components).

Two defects in the first attempt, both worth remembering: components are NOT
in `MemberDeclarations` (a VirtualNode-returning declaration parses into
`ComponentDeclaration` and surfaces as `ComponentName`), so the map was built
empty and fell through silently; and only one of the two component-emitter
call sites received it. An empty map is this fix's failure mode, so the map
now TRACES what it resolved, including an explicit "(none resolved through
imports; the assembly scan decides)".

### UB-224 — a source edit follows the FOCUS, and overwrites another module `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report, 2026-08-29: a `MiddleSide` card showed `NewComponent()` — its
signature, its imports, its whole markup — while `MiddleSide.uitkx` on disk was
perfectly correct. The library grew a second `<NewComponent>` and lost
`<MiddleSide>`. The owner diagnosed it before the code did: *"when you edit the
text, and click to select another component the edit still stay there, it doesnt
cancel the edit, and somewhere along those line its got copied and saved there."*

**Root cause: a snapshot that could not name its own file.** `_sourceSnapshot`
was a bare string, and every consumer resolved the target as
`_workspace.TryGet(_focusFile)` — whatever was focused at the moment they ran.
The focus-change block made that reachable, and its comment claimed the opposite
of what it did:

```csharp
// POC selectNode(): opening another file leaves source-edit mode.
_codeField.SetEditing(_sourceSnapshot != null);   // ← CARRIED the session across
```

So: edit NewComponent (snapshot taken), click the MiddleSide card (focus moves,
session survives, snapshot still NewComponent's), press Esc — `CancelSourceEdit`
restored NewComponent's text into MiddleSide's buffer. `ApplySourceEdit` had the
same defect, parsing the pane's text against `_focusFile`.

Three ordinary clicks, silent whole-file loss, in a save-only editor. Only the
buffer was hit; disk was never wrong, so Abort (or a Save from a clean state)
recovers.

**Fix:** the snapshot is not allowed to exist without its file.
`BuilderSourceEditSession` (`Builder/Editor/Document/`) carries both, cancel and
apply act on `session.FilePath` and never on the focus, and a focus change to a
different file ENDS the session — which is what the comment always said. Nothing
is lost by ending it: typing is applied to the buffer live, so the text is
already in the file it was typed into, and the ledger still holds it for undo.

**Regression cover:** the type is Unity-free and `Compile`-linked into
`Builder~/ModelTests` (`EditSessionChecks`, 22 checks) — including the corruption
itself as a check, plus the case-insensitive path comparison the window depends
on. `BuilderWindow` cannot be tested outside Unity, which is exactly why the
state moved out of it.

---

### UB-225 — the library list keeps the exports the tree had at MOUNT `FIXED` `MED`

Seen beside UB-224 and initially mistaken for its leftovers. The card corrected
itself the moment its buffer did; the LIBRARY went on listing `<NewComponent>`
twice and no `<MiddleSide>`, disagreeing with the tree it is drawn from.

**Root cause:** `SetWorkspaceEntries(graph)` — which rebuilds the Custom
components / Style modules / Util modules / hook-module sections from
`graph.Nodes` — was invoked from exactly one place, `Mount`'s `onGraphLoaded`
callback. But the graph changes after the mount: `RefreshGraph(path)` re-runs
`PopulateCardDetail`, which re-runs `FillExportsFromSource`, so a card's
**exports** can differ from a keystroke ago. It redrew the canvas and told
nobody. Every other graph-derived surface rides the same callback — the
known-element set (which UITKX0105 is checked against) and the preview's module
notes — so all of them held whatever was true at mount.

**Fix:** `BuilderCanvasHost` remembers the callback and fires it from
`RefreshGraph` as well as from `Mount`. A projection of the graph now updates
whenever the graph does, rather than once.

Renaming an export is the everyday way in: the library offered the old name
until the tree was remounted.

### UB-226 — a parent previews against its child's SAVED props, not the tree's `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report, 2026-08-29, while giving a component its first props through the
new signature gestures (#2). Every child compiled and previewed correctly on its
own; the PARENT would not compile:

```
NewComponent.uitkx(17,104): error CS0426:
  The type name 'LeftSideProps' does not exist in the type 'LeftSide'
```

The owner's answer to "just save it" is the whole point of the tool:
*"i dont want to save!!! thats the whole freaking point!!"*

**Root cause: the hot compile asked whether a child was NEW when the question was
whether its SHAPE had changed.** In `UitkxHmrCompiler`'s response-file build:

```csharp
// Only add cross-refs for genuinely new components;
// existing ones are already referenced and would cause CS0433
if (!_genuinelyNewComponents.Contains(kvp.Key))
    continue;
```

A component is "genuinely new" only when its FQN is in no pre-existing assembly.
`LeftSide` was not new — it was in the project assembly, compiled from the
version still on DISK, which had no parameters and therefore no nested
`LeftSideProps`. So its freshly built swap was deliberately not referenced and
the parent compiled against the stale type. That assumption held for as long as
HMR only ever swapped method bodies; adding a prop to a child became a
first-class gesture in 0.19.1, so it is now the main path, not an edge.

It is also the isolation principle with one seam left in it: the builder rendered
children from unsaved buffers, but a parent's compile still took each child's
TYPE from the assemblies Unity built from disk.

**Considered and rejected — inlining the child's source into the parent's
compilation.** It looks like the obvious fix and it is a trap the codebase had
already documented:

> *"An imported COMPONENT file is a candidate now too but is never inlined —
> component types resolve via the real assembly + alias payloads."*

Generated bodies read props with `__rawProps as FooProps` — an `as`, not a cast.
Two same-named props types in two assemblies do not throw; the match fails, the
null-coalesce substitutes a fresh instance, and the component renders with EVERY
PROP DEFAULTED, silently. That is the UB-223 class of failure with no error to
follow.

**Fix: compile the batch's components as ONE assembly** (`CompileBatch`, which
already existed for TECH_DEBT_20_21_22 §5.2.1 and was simply never wired to the
builder). One assembly means one definition of each component and therefore one
props type, so a parent cannot be handed a type from somewhere else. It is also
parity: a real Unity compile puts every component of an asmdef in one DLL, and
splitting them into per-module swaps is what manufactured the staleness. Style
and hook modules are not union-eligible and keep their per-file path, building
first in import order; when the union declines, the per-file loop still runs,
because that is what surfaces the real error to the user.

**Same-assembly is an invariant, not an optimisation.** Preview the parent (group
in one assembly), then a child alone (its own assembly), then the parent again:
every buffer matches what it was built from, so nothing is dirty and nothing
rebuilds — while the group is now split and the parent's props silently stop
matching. `ForceRebuildOnSplitAssembly` catches that, and the empty-dirty early
return had to move BELOW it or the check would never run in the one case it
exists for.

**Two diagnostics landed with it,** after a round of diagnosis was lost to their
absence: every compile round logs its composition (module count, component count,
whether the union was eligible) and a declined union logs its reason — both to
the console, unconditionally, not to the Trace toggle. A round that quietly
carried one module looked exactly like a round that carried five.

**Related, fixed in the same wave:** the preview compiled at `-langversion:latest`
while Unity compiles the project at 9.0 (confirmed against Unity's own generated
csproj), so the preview accepted C# 10 syntax that failed the next real build —
`var handler = () => { }` was the owner's live case. Both compile paths now pin
to the version Unity reports via `CompilationPipeline`.

### UB-01 — Builder exposes 2 of the 5 real directives `OPEN` `HIGH`

The row context menu offers exactly `Wrap in @if` and `Wrap in @foreach`
(`BuilderWindow.cs:695-705`). Missing: **`@for`, `@while`, `@switch`**, and
`@if`'s `@else if` / `@else` chain.

This is **not** a POC-parity gap. The POC only ever knew `@if` and `@foreach`
(`ruitkUiBuiler/index.html` contains those two strings and no others). Copying
the POC here copies a mock's toy vocabulary into a real editor. A file using
`@switch` opens in the builder today and the builder cannot describe, edit, or
preserve that construct through a move.

Blocked on the model question in §8.1.

### UB-02 — One badge slot per row: nested directives display WRONG today `OPEN` `HIGH`

Better news and worse news than first assessed. The graph service is **not**
regex-guessing markup — `WalkMarkup` (`BuilderGraphService.cs:832-919`) walks
the real AST and already visits all five constructs, including every
`@else if` branch and every `@case`. The bottleneck is purely the
representation: a directive is stamped onto the **first element row its clause
produced** via `Attach` (`:963-974`), and `BuilderCardLine` has **one badge
slot** (`BadgeText`/`DirectiveText`/`DirectiveLine`).

Confirmed consequences, each traceable to a line:

- **Nested directives show the wrong badge.** `Attach` bails on collision
  (`:969-970` — `if (row.BadgeKind != 0) return`). When a clause's first child
  is itself a directive, the inner one attaches first and the **outer construct
  silently vanishes from the card**. `Samples/.../NestedSection.uitkx`
  (`@if` inside `@foreach`) renders as a bare `@if` — the loop is invisible.
- **Empty clauses vanish.** `:966-967` — a branch whose body produced no rows
  (an empty `@else {}`) has nothing to attach to and disappears entirely.
- **Clause membership is invisible.** Directive bodies are walked at the SAME
  depth (`:874` passes `depth`, not `depth + 1`), so rows 2..N of a clause are
  indistinguishable from rows outside it.
- **An `@else` clause can be dragged away from its `@if`.** Every row with
  `rowIdx > 0` arms a move payload (`CanvasView.uitkx:1027-1028`), and a
  badge row's move carries `DirectiveLine..MatchingCloseLine`
  (`BuilderWindow.cs:991-995`) — for an `@else` badge that is the clause alone.
  Dropping it elsewhere strands an orphan `@else` and the file stops parsing.
- **`@for`, `@while`, `@case` and `@default` share BadgeKind 4**
  (`:895, :903, :913-914`) — the model cannot tell them apart except by
  display string.

Resolution designed and adopted — see §8.1.

### UB-03 — `Wrap in @foreach` emits code that cannot compile `OPEN` `HIGH`

Two independent failures, both of them certain:

1. **Unbound identifiers.** `WrapRowInDirective(…, "@foreach (var item in
   items)", …)` emits that header literally. `items` is not in scope in an
   arbitrary component and `item` is never referenced by the wrapped row. A
   correct wrap must offer in-scope enumerable symbols for the collection,
   bind the loop variable, and let the wrapped markup reference it.

2. **Loops yield an array, so they are illegal as a single root.** `@foreach`
   lowers to `Func<VirtualNode[]>`; `CSharpEmitter.cs:2600` raises
   **UITKX0025** when a loop directive is the single root of an inline `{…}`
   expression. Wrapping the only root row in `@foreach` therefore produces a
   hard compile error, where wrapping it in `@if` does not. The builder has no
   idea this asymmetry exists.

The second point generalises: **`@if`/`@switch` are node-valued and `@for`/
`@foreach`/`@while` are array-valued**, and the builder must know which it is
inserting and where arrays are legal.

### UB-04 — IDE layers offer directive syntax the parser rejects `OPEN` `MED`

Not a builder bug, but the builder consumes the same LSP, so it inherits every
one of these. Found while establishing the ground truth above:

- `lsp-server/CompletionHandler.cs:1216-1218` and `HoverHandler.cs:591-593`
  offer an **arrow** switch form (`@case $1 => $0`, `@default => …`). The
  parser only accepts `:` (`UitkxParser.cs:1300-1317`). Accepting the
  completion produces code that does not parse.
- The same arrow form is in `grammar/uitkx.tmLanguage.json:286`,
  `vscode/syntaxes/uitkx.tmLanguage.json:286`, and
  `visual-studio/UitkxVsix/UitkxClassifier.cs:1162` as a `switch-arm-label`
  rule.
- `CompletionHandler.cs:475-482` completes `break` / `continue` inside loop and
  switch blocks. `@continue` is **always** an error; `@break` has no AST node.
- `UITKX0110` (`UnreachableAfterBreakOrContinue`) is declared
  (`DiagnosticCodes.cs:99-104`) and never emitted — its only consumer is a
  suppression filter in `DiagnosticsPublisher.cs:632-636`.
- `SourceGenerator~/Diagnostics/UitkxDiagnostics.cs:124-132` holds a dead
  `UnknownDirective` descriptor whose message still lists a valid `code`
  directive and whose severity is `Warning` against the parser's `Error`.
  Nothing in `SourceGenerator~` references it.
- `uitkx-schema.json -> controlFlow` descriptions are **stale**: they claim
  `@if` "generates a ternary", `@foreach` "generates .Select().ToArray()", and
  `@switch` "generates a C# switch expression". The emitter generates IIFEs
  for all five (`CSharpEmitter.cs:1983-2128`). The builder's directive menu
  (§8.1) must consume the NAMES, never these descriptions, until the schema is
  fixed.

### UB-05 — Editable surfaces have no colouring, no completion, no diagnostics `OPEN` `HIGH`

Every place the builder lets you type should behave like an editor. Nine of the
ten do not. Audited surface by surface:

| Surface | Colour | Completion | Diagnostics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source pane, **read** mode | yes | n/a | yes |
| Source pane, **edit** mode | **no** | Ctrl+Space only | yes |
| Canvas attribute-value editor (`CanvasView.uitkx:1152-1180`) | no | no | no |
| Canvas directive/badge editor (`:1039-1067`) | no | no | no |
| Canvas hook-chip editor (`:494-522`) | no | no | no |
| Canvas style-entry editor (`:829-859`) | no | no | no |
| Canvas code-island editor (`:636-666`) | no | no | no |
| Canvas line-rewrite (`:798-827`) | no | no | no |
| `BuilderSearchMenu` field (`BuilderSearchMenu.cs:195-224`) | no | substring filter over caller-supplied items — not LSP | no |
| Library search (`BuilderLibraryPane.cs:140-165`) | no | substring filter | no |

Even the one working completion is thin: Ctrl+Space only
(`CodeField.cs:361-364`), unreachable outside edit mode because `_input` is
`display:none` (`:228`); the popup is pinned to a fixed corner
(`top:22, right:8`, `:404-405`) rather than the caret; capped at 25 items
(`:420`); no filter-as-you-type, no docs, and it ignores the LSP's `textEdit`
range, just calling `InsertAtCaret(insertText)` (`:431`).

### UB-06 — Half the LSP client is dead code `OPEN` `HIGH`

`Lsp/BuilderLspClient.cs` implements the requests and nothing calls them:

| Method | Line | Called? |
|---|---|---|
| `RequestCompletion` | `:508` | yes — `BuilderWindow.cs:585`, the only caller |
| `RequestSchema` / `RequestHooks` | `:499-500` | yes |
| `RequestWorkspaceGraph` | `:505` | yes |
| `RequestHover` | `:515` | **never** |
| `RequestSemanticTokens` | `:529` | **never** |
| `RequestFormatting` | `:522` | **never** |
| `RequestComponentProps` | `:502` | **never** (see UB-13) |
| `DiagnosticsPublished` event | `:48`, fired `:395` | **no subscriber** |

The last one has real consequences: the server publishes tier-3 / Roslyn
diagnostics (`lsp-server/DiagnosticsPublisher.cs`), the client marshals them to
the main thread (`:383-399`), and nothing listens. `BuilderLanguage.cs:80-82`
even documents that T3 "is overlaid by the caller" — no caller does. **The
builder can never show a type error.**

Colouring and diagnostics come instead from the in-process facade
`Lang/BuilderLanguage.cs` (`Parse` `:30`, `Tokens` `:103`, `Diagnose` `:83`),
which is legitimate and fast — but it is tier-1 + tier-2 only.

### UB-07 — `knownElements` is null everywhere, so custom tags are never classified `OPEN` `HIGH`

**This is the root cause of the "syntax/style component colouring is off"
observation, and it is a one-line class of fix.**

`CodeField.SetContent(..., knownElements)` is passed **`null` at all four call
sites** (`BuilderWindow.cs:464, 534, 606, 1730`). That null flows into both
`BuilderLanguage.Tokens` and `BuilderLanguage.Diagnose`, so:

- custom-component tags are never classified and therefore never get the
  custom-tag colour — they fall back to whatever the default is;
- the tier-2 unknown-element check
  (`language-lib/Diagnostics/DiagnosticsAnalyzer.cs:669`) is guarded by
  `projectElements != null` and so **can never fire in this window**.

The builder already holds both the schema and the graph. It just never passes
them.

Separately, the palette itself may also be wrong — see UB-21.

### UB-08 — Style-key menu emits non-compiling code `OPEN` `CRITICAL`

`BuilderWindow.cs:1293-1304` hardcodes 26 `(Key, Type)` tuples. The real
surface is `Shared/Props/Typed/StyleKeys.cs` — **92** keys, with 92 matching
properties on `Style` (`Style.cs:384-1269`).

**Two of the 26 offered keys do not exist and produce a compile error when
picked:**

- `("Gap", "length")` (line 1299) — `Gap` appears nowhere in `Shared/Props/`.
- `("UnityTextAlign", "text-align")` (line 1302) — the RUITK member is
  `TextAlign` (`Style.cs:943`). `UnityTextAlign` is the IMGUI name.

Picking either writes `Gap = Px(8),` or `UnityTextAlign = TextMiddleCenter,`
into a `.style.uitkx` export, which then fails to compile. This is the single
most damaging item in the register: the builder actively breaks the user's
file.

The other **66 of 92** keys are simply unreachable — every `Border*Color`,
`BorderTopLeftRadius`, `Left/Top/Right/Bottom`, `Rotate/Scale/Translate`,
`Transition*`, `Filter`, `AspectRatio`, `UnitySlice*`, `TextShadow`,
`WordSpacing`, `Visibility`, `Overflow`, `WhiteSpace`.

Related: `ValueTemplatesFor` (`:1306-1319`) hardcodes ~35 value literals keyed
on pseudo-types (`"length"`, `"color"`, `"justify"`) that are themselves
invented by `s_styleKeys` and correspond to nothing. The real sources are
`uitkx-schema.json -> styleKeyValues` (25 keys with their true enum value sets)
and `Shared/Props/Typed/CssHelpers.cs` for helper tokens.

### UB-09 — Attribute menu falls back to an 11-entry list, 3 of them fake `OPEN` `HIGH`

`Lsp/BuilderSchemaCache.cs:29-42` holds `s_common`, 11 hardcoded `AttrInfo`.
The schema the builder **already downloads** carries
`intrinsicElementAttributes` (60) + `structuralAttributes` (2: `key`, `ref`)
and the builder throws both arrays away, reading only `elements[*].attributes`.

- **3 of the 11 do not exist**: `usageHints`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`
  (the real events are `onPointerEnter` / `onPointerLeave`).
- Missing entirely: `key`, `ref`, `className`, `visible`, `enabled`,
  `tabIndex`, `extraProps`, and all 20 `*Capture` handlers.

Worse, the fallback is **silent**. `BuilderSchemaCache.Register` has exactly
one call site (`BuilderLibraryPane.cs:240`), inside `Attach`. If the LSP throws
— the `catch` at `BuilderLibraryPane.cs:276` returns early — `s_byElement`
stays empty and every element degrades to those 11 entries with no warning. The
user cannot tell a real schema from a dead one.

`AttrInfo` (`:16-24`) also drops the schema's per-attribute `description`, so
the menu can never show docs.

### UB-10 — "Add child element" offers 7 of 72 elements `OPEN` `MED`

`ShowAddChildMenu` (`BuilderWindow.cs:739-773`) uses `NativeTagOrder`
(`BuilderLibraryPane.cs:35-38`) as its entire native list. That constant is
correct where it was written — it is a **curation order** for the library pane,
which then renders all 72 schema elements after it. Reusing it as a source list
silently truncates to 7.

`SeededTag` (`:776-779`) seeds default attributes for exactly 2 tags (`Label`,
`Button`); every other element inserts bare.

### UB-11 — Hook insertion is hardcoded for 4 of 21 hooks `OPEN` `HIGH`

The LIBRARY pane is correct — it merges the live `ruitk/hooks` response
(`HookRegistry.AmbientHookNames` + `GetDocMap()`, 21 hooks) at
`BuilderLibraryPane.cs:253-274`. My earlier note that it showed only 4 was
wrong; the 4 in `HookTemplates` (`:43-46`) are an offline seed and an ordering
hint.

What is actually broken is **insertion**. `BuilderWindow.cs:917-921` hardcodes
declaration text for `useState` / `useEffect` / `useMemo` / `useRef` and falls
back to `"var value = " + name + "();"` for everything else — wrong for most of
the remaining 17. `HookRegistry` already emits real stubs
(`HookStubsStaticForm` / `HookStubsInstanceForm`), so the correct declaration
is available and unused.

Second-order: the offline seed means a dead LSP shows a plausible 4-hook list
instead of an error.

### UB-12 — Preview STATE panel silently truncates `OPEN` `MED`

`Preview/BuilderPreviewPane.cs:453-462` hand-partitions hooks into
`s_slotHooks` (7) and `s_noSlotHooks` (2) to index `HookStates` positionally.
That covers 9 of the 21 registry hooks. For a component using `useSignal`,
`useDeferredValue`, `useTransition`, `useAnimate`, `useTweenFloat`, `useSfx`,
`useUiDocumentRoot`, `useStableCallback`, `useImperativeHandle` or
`provideContext`, `CollectStateNames` bails at `:489` and the STATE panel
truncates **with no indication that it did**.

Proper fix is at the source: slot arity belongs on `HookRegistry` as a field,
not in a hand-maintained list in the preview pane.

### UB-13 — Component props are re-derived by string-splitting `OPEN` `MED`

`PropsOf` (`BuilderWindow.cs:1265-1291`) splits `BuilderCanvasNode.Signature`
on `(`, `,`, `=` and last-space to recover `(Name, Type)` pairs, then appends a
synthetic `("key", "list key")`.

The real thing already exists on both ends: `ruitk/componentProps` ->
`RuitkComponentPropsHandler` (`lsp-server/RuitkBuilderRequests.cs:145-179`)
returns `Name`, `Type`, `Doc`, `Line` from the real `WorkspaceIndex`, and the
client method `BuilderLspClient.RequestComponentProps` (`:502-503`) is
implemented. It has **zero call sites in the repo**. A live real source sitting
next to a fake parser that is used instead.

### UB-14 — Attribute insertion emits `{value}` for every non-string type `OPEN` `HIGH`

`DefaultValueFor` (`BuilderSchemaCache.cs:61-72`) is a name heuristic that ends
in a catch-all:

```csharp
if (on*-handler || type.Contains("Action")) return "{handler}";
if (name == "style" || type == "Style")     return "{styleName}";
if (type == "string" || name is "text"/"label") return "\"text\"";
return "{value}";   // bool, int, float, enum, Color ALL land here
```

Used at `BuilderWindow.cs:1192`, written into the tag at `:1205`. So
`focusable` becomes `focusable={value}`, `pickingMode` becomes
`pickingMode={value}`, a `Color` prop becomes `{value}` — **none of which
compile**. Together with UB-08 this is the second way the builder writes broken
code into the user's file.

The type is known and is even displayed in the menu label
(`BuilderWindow.cs:1249`) before `DefaultValueFor` discards it. Some invention
is unavoidable — the schema carries no defaults — but it must at least be
type-driven.

### UB-15 — Live preview is real; its failure modes are silent `OPEN` `MED`

The preview is genuinely real, and this is worth recording because the campaign
kept re-litigating it. `BuilderPreviewPane.Mount()` (`:831-842`) builds a real
`HostContext` via `RuitkBootstrap.CreateHostContext`, with its own budgeted
scheduler (`BuilderRenderScheduler`, 4 ms/tick), and renders the generated
component's real `Render`. Clicking a Button in the preview runs the real
handler, mutates real fiber state, and re-renders; interactive controls are
exempted from the click-to-select gesture (`:793-796`). The STATE strip reads
`fiber.ComponentState.HookStates` twice a second (`:366-409`) and writes back
(`:502-602`). Edits re-render after a 300 ms debounce, and **no Save is
needed** — `SourceOverlay` (`BuilderPreviewCompiler.cs:44`) makes
`UitkxHmrCompiler` read the unsaved buffer.

What is wrong is that **every failure path is silent**:

- `Mount()` has **no try/catch** (`:831-842`), and `CreateDefaultProps` is a
  bare `Activator.CreateInstance` (`:991-1004`), so reference props are `null`.
  A component that dereferences a required prop throws out of the render into
  `EditorApplication.update`.
- `CompileDirty` **breaks on the first failure** (`BuilderPreviewCompiler.cs:75-77`),
  so one broken sibling stops the loop before the focus file is ever reached;
  `focusResult` stays null and the pane keeps the stale render with no message.
- Only **dirty** sessions compile (`:59-67`). A freshly opened file depends on
  the assembly Unity's generator already produced — if the project does not
  compile there is no preview and no explanation.
- Import ordering resolves **relative specifiers only** (`:130-135`); `~/`
  cross-tree and `@` package imports are skipped, so a dirty peer reached via
  `~/` can compile out of order.
- On compile failure the pane shows one generic line
  (`BuilderWindow.cs:1876-1880`); the real error only reaches the Unity console.
- Knob seeding is heuristic: literals are mined from the *first* usage found on
  the canvas (`:1120-1137`), and object props get knobs regex-mined from card
  text and seeded with fabricated values (`:1142-1234`).

### Correctly reading a real source today — do not "fix" these

Library native elements (all 72, `BuilderLibraryPane.cs:226-251`); library
hooks (`:253-274`); library components / style / hook / util modules from the
live graph (`:292-355`); the workspace graph
(`BuilderGraphService.cs:152`, with `-32801` retry at `:145-165`, card detail
re-parsed from the live buffer at `:203-221`); `UsedStyleKeys`
(`BuilderWindow.cs:1350-1377`); remove-attribute (`:1150-1173`); and
`CheckSchemaDrift` (`BuilderCanvasHost.cs:408-434`), which cross-checks the
schema against the live `ElementRegistry` and warns on drift.

One scoping caveat worth knowing: the graph is only the **connected component
of the focus file** (`BuilderGraphService.cs:80-84`), not the whole project, so
components in an unrelated tree never appear in the library.

## 2. Visual defects the owner observed

These came from looking at the window, which is the only source that has caught
appearance bugs reliably.

### UB-20 — Edges have no terminal point and attach on the wrong side `OPEN` `HIGH`

Every curve should end in a visible point, and the attachment should be the
**right-most** edge of the component, at every layer.

Today (`Canvas/BuilderCanvasDrawing.cs:676-686`, `DrawEdges`):
- the **target** end is `rect.xMin` — the card's **left** edge — and paints no
  terminal dot at all;
- the **source** end at L1/L2 is the measured anchor dot on the import/markup
  row (correct-ish), but at **L0** it is `CardRect(...).center`, so the curve
  starts inside the card body and crosses over it.

Both are faithful ports of the POC (`x1 = r1.right - r1.width/2`,
`x2 = r2.left`). Changing them is a **deliberate divergence from the POC** in
favour of legibility. See §8.3 — the exact geometry is a decision, not a
lookup.

### UB-21 — Source pane token colours are the wrong palette `OPEN` `MED`

Two separate causes, and **UB-07 is the bigger one** — custom-component tags
are never classified at all, because `knownElements` is `null` at every
`SetContent` call site. Fix that first, then re-look.

What may remain after UB-07: the palette itself. Hypothesis to confirm in
`Controls/CodeField.cs` — tokens mapped to VS Code Dark+ (`#569CD6` keyword
blue, `#CE9178` string orange) instead of the POC palette (`#c792ea` keyword
purple, `#c3e88d` string green, `#7fdbca` custom tag).

Note that canvas-side "colouring" is not tokenised at all — it is ad-hoc rich
text (`BuilderCanvasDrawing.cs:198` signature, `:213` hook chip, `:255` style
export head), so it cannot track the palette automatically.

### UB-22 — Anchor dots are occluded by overlapping cards `OPEN` `HIGH`

Root cause: **the dots and the curves are not coplanar.** Anchor dots are
child elements inside each card's subtree (`a-imp-<i>-<r>`, `a-row-<i>-<r>`),
but edges paint into a single overlay layer that is the **last sibling** of the
world (`CanvasView.uitkx:1299-1304`). So an overlapping card draws over the
underlying card's dots while the curves sail over the top of everything — the
exact split visible in the L1 screenshot, where the `UitkxTestFileDoNotTouch`
import dots vanish under `MultiColumnListViewStatefulDemoFunc`.

Fix at the layer where the bug lives: paint the dots in the edge overlay (their
positions are already measured there by `AnchorOf`), rather than bumping card
z-order, which only moves the occlusion to a different pair of cards.

Interacts with UB-23 and §8.2.

### UB-23 — Cards have unbounded height `OPEN` `MED` `DESIGN`

No card section is height-capped; the only `ScrollView` on a card is the
horizontal island scroller (`ruitk-island-scroll`). A component with a long
markup body grows a card until it overlaps its neighbours — which is what
*produces* UB-22 in the first place, and what makes the L1 canvas unreadable on
the fixture.

The fix (cap section height, scroll inside) has a hard consequence for anchors
and edges: a dot scrolled out of its section still reports a `worldBound`, so
the curve would attach to a point outside the visible region. Blocked on §8.2.

### UB-24 — L0 pill cards are unreadably small `OPEN` `MED`

The POC compensates for the 0.30 L0 zoom with enlarged pill typography (26px
title) so cards stay legible. Ours keeps L1 type sizes and shrinks to
unreadable chips — visible in the L0 screenshot, where every card title is a
smear.

### UB-25 — Source pane turns white in edit mode `OPEN` `MED`

Root cause confirmed, and it is not a shade problem. `CodeField` keeps **two**
views: a coloured `.srcline` listing (`:503-567`, `:701-752`) and a plain
`TextField` (`#src-edit`, `:209-234`). `SetEditing` (`:258-268`) hides the
listing and shows the field, and the field has **no colouring at all** — so
edit mode is not a lighter shade of the listing, it is a different, unlit
control.

The POC also drops to a textarea, so this is technically parity. It is still
wrong for a real editor, and it is the same defect as UB-05: the answer is that
edit mode should stay coloured, which means the listing and the editable
surface have to become one control rather than two.

### UB-26 — Edges cross card bodies `OPEN` `LOW`

Partly z-order (UB-22), mostly layout: the auto-placement crowds cards so
curves have no clear channel. Likely resolves as a side effect of UB-23 +
UB-20; re-check after those.

---

## 3. Drag and drop

### UB-30 — Picking up a library item gives no feedback `OPEN` `HIGH`

`BuilderDragService` (`Library/BuilderDragService.cs`) is a single `static
string Payload`. Arming it changes nothing on screen: no drag ghost, no
"picked" styling on the source row, no cursor change. `DragActive` is read only
by canvas rows, to decide whether to band-hint **once the pointer is already
over one**. Between press and arrival at a target row the user has no evidence
anything is happening — which is exactly the reported symptom.

Needs a real drag visual: a ghost element following the pointer carrying the
payload's label, plus a held-down state on the source row.

### UB-31 — The drop band is read from a stale render closure `OPEN` `HIGH`

Root cause, and it explains both "not always accurate" and "the first drop
doesn't even add the component".

`CanvasView.uitkx:997-1010`: `onPointerMove` calls `setDragBand(...)` — fiber
component state. `onPointerUp` then reads `dragBand`. But the handler closes
over the value from **the render that created it**, so a pointer-up that
arrives before the state-driven re-render commits reads the *previous* band.
On the first drop of a session that previous value is the initial state, which
is why the first drop misbehaves the most.

Compounding: `setDragRowKey`/`setDragBand` fire on **every** pointer move, so
the tree re-renders per move and the band lags the cursor by a frame.

Fix: the band and target row are drag-machine state, not render state — hold
them in `BuilderDragService` (or a ref) and read them at drop time. Keep the
`setState` only for the hint's visual.

### UB-32 — No pointer capture; a drop that misses a row is silently swallowed `OPEN` `MED`

Nothing calls `CapturePointer` on drag start. Pointer-up is delivered to
whatever element is under the cursor, so releasing over a card gap, a section
header, or the canvas background never reaches a row's drop handler — and the
world's own `onPointerUp` (`CanvasView.uitkx:123-124`) calls
`BuilderDragService.Cancel()`. The drag evaporates with no message.

The library row is worse: it registers `PointerUpEvent -> Cancel()` on itself
(`Library/BuilderLibraryPane.cs:522-524`) to preserve click-to-insert, so a
press-and-release without travel is indistinguishable from an aborted drag.

Fix: capture the pointer on arm, resolve the drop from the captured stream's
final position by hit-test, and surface an explicit "no valid drop target"
cancel rather than a silent one.

---

## 4. Chrome and controls

### UB-40 — Layer control should be a labelled dropdown `OPEN` `LOW`

`BuilderWindow.cs:131-140` builds three toggle buttons labelled
`L0 Architecture` / `L1 Cards` / `L2 Edit`. Wanted: a single select, with
human labels — `Layer 1 …`, `Layer 2 …`, `Layer 3 …`. Note the renumbering:
the internal presets stay 0/1/2 with zooms 0.30 / 0.75 / 1.25, but the user
sees 1-based names. Keep one mapping table so the label set and the preset
array cannot drift.

---

## 5. Committed but never seen on screen

Carried from parity round 1 (commit `4191c90a`). All gated, none watched.

| Id | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| UB-50 | Util module multi-line function signatures render as one collapsed head | `UNVERIFIED` |
| UB-51 | `+ style` / `+ export` affordance shows when a module has no parsed exports | `UNVERIFIED` |

Closed from the same round, confirmed on screen: canvas dot grid; L2 code
island for wrapped export headers; anchor dot on every IMPORTS row; full
native-elements list.

---

## 6. Reviewed from source only — never captured

No screenshot harness state exists for any of these, so their parity is a code
reading, not an observation.

| Id | Surface |
|---|---|
| UB-60 | Context menus — row, card, canvas |
| UB-61 | Searchable menu chrome (`BuilderSearchMenu`) |
| UB-62 | Drag bands and drop hints (see also UB-30..32) |
| UB-63 | Hover states |
| UB-64 | New File dialog |
| UB-65 | Source pane edit -> apply cycle |
| UB-66 | Help overlay |

---

## 7. Accepted divergences — do not re-flag

- **Text rasterisation.** Unity's text engine will never match a browser's.
- **Live preview content.** Ours mounts the real component; the POC scripts a
  fake shop screen. Ours is correct.
- **Save / Abort buttons.** The POC never writes a file. Owner-decided.
- **Library column is fixed-width.** The POC wires only two splitters.

---

## 8. Design decisions (resolved 2026-08-16 with the owner)

All three questions are now decided. This section is the implementation spec;
the POC is explicitly NOT the reference for any of it (its directive knowledge
was two keywords, its edge geometry is what UB-20 exists to replace).

### 8.1 Directive model — DECIDED: clause head rows, schema-named menu

**A directive clause becomes a card row of its own** (`BuilderCardLineKind.
Directive` — the enum member already exists), replacing the `Attach`
badge-stamping. Nesting falls out for free because `WalkMarkup` already
recurses over the real AST; the samples' nested forms (`NestedSection.uitkx`)
become representable exactly, where today they display wrongly (UB-02).

**Model** (`BuilderGraphModel.cs`): head rows reuse `BadgeText` (keyword),
`DirectiveText` (full header — `FillDirectiveText` unchanged), `DirectiveLine`
(clause head line). Add two ints: `CloseLine` (clause close brace) and
`ClauseIndex` (0 = construct head; >0 = structurally bound continuation:
`@else if`, `@else`, `@case`, `@default`). `CloseLine` is computed builder-side
from `ControlBlockPayload.BodyCodeLine` + the newline count of `BodyCode`
(verified: the AST carries per-clause `SourceLine` but no end line — no
language-lib change, no DLL rebuild, no parity ripple).

**Walker** (`BuilderGraphService.WalkMarkup`): each clause emits its head row,
then walks its body at `depth + 1` (switch: `@switch` head, `@case` heads at
`depth + 1`, bodies at `depth + 2`). `Attach` and its collision/empty-clause
bugs are deleted. A clause with setup code before its `return` renders that as
a code island under the head, same as the L2 body island.

**Renderer** (`CanvasView.uitkx`): a Directive row renders as a badge-chip
row. Click = the existing inline header editor (`OnDirectiveEdit` path is
line-based and survives unchanged). Directive rows carry no anchor dot.

**Move/drag rules** (`BuilderWindow`): a `ClauseIndex == 0` head drags the
WHOLE construct — first clause's `DirectiveLine` through the last clause's
`CloseLine`. A `ClauseIndex > 0` head is **not draggable** (an `@else` cannot
live anywhere else — today it can be dragged into garbage, UB-02); its menu
offers edit-condition / delete-clause instead. Element rows inside a clause
drag themselves, as today. Drop band "inside" on a head row inserts at the top
of that clause's body.

**Menu** (`BuilderWindow`): the wrap list is built from
`uitkx-schema.json -> controlFlow` **names** (never the descriptions — they are
stale, UB-04), intersected with a builder-side capability table keyed by name:

| name | role | wrap? | yields |
|---|---|---|---|
| `if` | construct | yes | node |
| `foreach`, `for`, `while` | construct | where an array is legal | array |
| `switch` | construct | yes | node |
| `else`, `case`, `default` | clause-add (head-row menu) | no | — |

A `CheckSchemaDrift`-style startup check warns when the schema names a
directive the table does not cover — the builder can never silently trail the
language again. `break`/`continue` are never offered (no AST node / always an
error).

**Clause adds**: `@if` head menu — "Add @else if" / "Add @else" (disabled when
an `@else` exists); `@switch` head — "Add @case…" / "Add @default" (disabled
when one exists). Each is a small text edit at the clause boundary
(`} @else {`) through `ApplyProgrammaticEdit`.

**Loop wraps bind their collection** (UB-03): the `@foreach` wrap opens a
searchable menu of in-scope enumerables — component props with
collection-shaped types (via `ruitk/componentProps`, which UB-13 wires up —
dependency), hook lhs vars from the card's BODY rows, then the warn-orange
freeform fallback. The loop variable is singularised from the collection name
and collision-checked. Loop wraps are disabled (with a tooltip citing
UITKX0025) where a single node is required.

### 8.2 Card section heights — DECIDED: max-height + scroll, clamped anchors

Sections cap their height and scroll (owner's original preference; the fold
alternative is dropped). The anchor problem the owner spotted is real but
cheap to solve — three mechanics, all riding existing machinery:

1. **Position is already live.** `DrawEdges` re-measures every dot's
   `worldBound` per repaint (`AnchorOf`, `BuilderCanvasDrawing.cs:646-661`).
   A dot inside a scrolled `ScrollView` keeps reporting its true, moved
   worldBound (clipping does not affect bounds), so "where is the row now"
   costs nothing new.
2. **Visibility is one rect test.** Compare the dot's centre against the
   section viewport's `worldBound` y-range. Outside → the row is scrolled out.
3. **Scrolled-out anchors clamp to the viewport edge.** The curve terminates
   at the section's top or bottom edge, in the dot's own colour — never at the
   true-but-clipped position (without the clamp the curve would dive under the
   card chrome, the exact "stick to the hidden part" failure). The clamp edge
   also tells you which way to scroll, and multiple hidden rows bundle there
   naturally. Since dots are painted in the overlay (8.3), the clamped dot is
   painted at the clamp point in the same pass.

   (Variant, owner's suggestion: collapse to a section-header dot instead.
   Equally cheap, but sections have no header dot today, so it adds an
   element; edge-clamp adds none. Either is a one-enum swap later.)

Plus one wire: each section `ScrollView`'s scroller `valueChanged` →
`edgeLayer.MarkDirtyRepaint()`, so edges track the scroll live instead of
lagging to the next repaint.

### 8.3 Edge anchors — DECIDED: dots into the overlay; right-edge source, terminal point

- **Anchor dots move into the edge overlay layer** (owner-approved). The row
  elements stay as invisible measurement markers; the visible glyphs are
  painted by `DrawEdges` in the overlay, so no card can ever occlude them
  (UB-22) and the terminal cap is painted in the same pass.
- **Source attaches at the card's right edge at every layer** — including L0,
  which today uses the card centre and draws curves out of the card's body.
- **Every curve ends in a visible terminal point** at the target end, matching
  the source dot's colour per edge kind.

Default interpretation of "always to the right most": source side. If the
owner instead wants BOTH ends on the right (rail-diagram routing, curves loop
back into the target's right edge), that is a routing change on top of this —
say so and it becomes its own item.

---

## 9. Field reports — owner drive-through, 2026-08-16

The create menu and drag-and-drop passed the owner's hands-on. These are the
defects and feature asks from that session, plus one the screenshots caught
that the owner did not name. All `OPEN` unless marked.

### UB-70 — Enter in a freshly added @case badge editor opens the file in VS2022 `OPEN` `HIGH`

Only on NEW cases (Add @case…), never on existing badges. Hypothesis: the
new-clause editor is pushed via `BeginEditOnDirectiveLine` AFTER the graph
refresh, and the TextField does not have keyboard focus yet when the user
presses Enter — the keystroke lands on the last-focused Unity pane (Project
window with the .uitkx selected → `OpenAsset` → the OS default app, VS2022).
Existing badges open their editor synchronously from the click, so focus is in
the field. Fix direction: the host-pushed inline editors must grab focus when
they materialise, and the badge editor's Enter/Esc must consume the event.

### UB-71 — @switch clause ordering: @default seeds first, @case appends after it `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Confirmed in the drive-through screenshots: `Wrap in @switch` seeds `@default:`
as the FIRST arm, and every "Add @case…" inserts above the switch's closing
brace — i.e. after @default, with no way to put a case above it. Fix: the wrap
seeds `@case value:` first (with the wrapped row) and `@default:` last;
"Add @case…" inserts BEFORE the @default arm when one exists, after the last
@case otherwise.

SHIPPED: `WrapRowInSwitch` now seeds `@switch (0) { @case 0: … }` holding the
wrapped row and seeds NO @default at all — "Add @default" stays on the menu and
appends at the closing brace, which is where C# wants it. `AddSwitchClause`
takes the node + row index and inserts a new @case at the @default arm's line
when one exists (`ConstructClause`, the row-returning form of the old
`ConstructHasClause`), else at the closing brace. Also fixed: the wrap emitted
its `);` one indent level too deep in BOTH wrappers — the house form every
sample uses aligns it with its own `return (`.

### UB-72 — seeded directive headers do not compile until edited `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

`@case value:` and `@if (condition)` reference identifiers that do not exist;
since the preview now reports compile failures loudly (UB-15), every wrap
immediately shows "Preview compile failed … CS1525" until the header is
edited. The owner's report began "when i create a directive and" and cut off —
this is the likely subject; OWNER: please finish that sentence if it was
something else. Options: seed compilable placeholders where a type can be
guessed, or hold the programmatic commit until the header editor closes with
real content (the edit-first flow the badge editor already implies).

SHIPPED (option 1, compilable placeholders — option 2 would have had the header
editor anchor to a canvas row that does not exist until the commit):
`@if (true)`, `@for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++)`, `@while (false)`, `@switch (0)`
+ `@case 0:`. @while seeds FALSE deliberately — a true-seeded render loop would
not terminate. Added @case arms seed the next unused integer (`NextCaseLabel`),
so they compile against the seeded subject and cannot collide (CS0152). The
header editor still opens on the seed, so the prompt to replace it is
unchanged; what is gone is the buffer being committed broken.

### UB-73 — action ledger with global undo/redo `UNVERIFIED` `FEATURE`

Owner ask: a visible ledger of every builder action, "down to the smallest
action", with undo/redo across it. Today undo is per-file session buffers
(Ctrl+Z on the focus file); moves, drops, clause surgery, deletes and
cross-file effects (auto-added imports) are only reachable by undoing whole
buffer states file by file. Design: one action log (description + the set of
(file, before, after) buffer pairs per action), a history panel, Ctrl+Z/Y
walking it atomically across files.

SHIPPED exactly that shape: `Builder/Editor/Document/BuilderActionLedger.cs` —
entries of (Description, At, List<(FilePath, Before, After)>), Begin/Record/End
with COLLAPSING nesting (a compound gesture reusing a single-file primitive
stays one entry), a redo tail truncated on new work, a 400-entry cap, and a
`Suppress()` scope so replaying is never itself recorded. `ApplyProgrammaticEdit`
(the funnel all nine delete/edit operations already went through), source-pane
typing and the source-edit cancel all record. Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y now
walk the LEDGER, not the focus file's own stack, so a gesture that touched two
files reverts as one step from whichever file is in focus. A "History" toolbar
button opens a panel listing every action with the cursor drawn live; clicking
any row walks the buffers to that point in one atomic step (`WalkTo`).

### UB-74 — selection-driven keyboard model: Delete removes, Esc cancels `UNVERIFIED` `FEATURE`

Owner ask: Delete deletes whatever is selected — element row, directive
clause/block, card, attribute — not just via the context menu; Esc cancels the
active edit anywhere. Needs a real selection model (exactly one selected THING
with a kind, visible focus) rather than today's per-surface selection bits.

SHIPPED: the fiber's row selection now leaves the component — a new
`onRowSelect(path, rowIdx, line)` prop mirrors into `BuilderCanvasHost`
(`SelectedRowPath/Index/Line`, matching the `_selectPath` pattern the card ring
already used). `BuilderWindow.OnKeyDown` no longer early-returns on unmodified
keys: Delete runs `DeleteSelection` (row selection beats card selection), Escape
runs `CancelActiveEdit` (inline editor, then source-pane edit, then clear the
selection). Both are suppressed while a text surface holds focus, so Delete
still deletes CHARACTERS inside an editor. Every menu guard is honoured by
routing to the same methods — return root refuses with a toast, a continuation
clause deletes as a clause, a construct head deletes its block, and the card
delete goes through `RequestDeleteCard`, which is the referenced-by guard
EXTRACTED out of `ShowCardMenu` so the two paths cannot drift.

### UB-75 — false UITKX0105 on Vector2Field/Vector3Field/… `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Caught in the drive-through screenshots (not owner-named): the source pane
flags `<Vector2Field>` etc. as unknown elements. UB-07 wired the check to the
SCHEMA element set, and the schema is missing 7 REGISTERED elements
(Vector2Field, Vector3Field, Vector4Field, Vector2IntField, Vector3IntField,
Hash128Field, UguiHost — the drift warning has said so all along). Two-part
fix: (a) builder-side now — `KnownElementsOrNull` unions the RUNTIME registry
(`ElementRegistryProvider.GetDefaultRegistry().RegisteredNames`, the actual
truth for what renders) so real elements are never errors; (b) root — add the
7 elements to `uitkx-schema.json` with real attribute lists so the palette
and completion offer them (add-unity-version-style work).

SHIPPED both halves. (a) `KnownElementsOrNull` unions
`ElementRegistryProvider.GetDefaultRegistry().RegisteredNames`, so schema drift
can cost completion but can never manufacture a UITKX0105 for a tag that
actually renders. (b) All 7 (Vector2/3/4Field, Vector2Int/Vector3IntField,
Hash128Field, UguiHost) added to `uitkx-schema.json` with their real attributes
read off the Props classes. NOTE: the schema is an EMBEDDED LSP resource — the
builder reads it over `RequestSchema`, so the palette/completion half only
lands once the LSP server is rebuilt and the extensions re-published.

### UB-76 — inline-editor intellisense, UN-DEFERRED `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-16 (`158813e0`), awaiting the owner's drive-through: one
floating inline editor (fragment-mode CodeField at the window root) replaces
all six in-card TextFields — shared colouring, coloured-edit overlay and
Ctrl+Space completion at the exact mapped file position for every surface
(line-splice for headers/chips/entries, tag-span mapping for attribute values,
re-indented range for islands), with the real buffer re-synced on close. The
overlay owns focus from the frame it opens, so UB-70's stray-Enter race is
structurally gone — verify both together. Original plan text follows.

The owner rejected the UB-05a deferral ("we have many tests that should all be
intellisensed/colored"). Active plan, superseding the REMAINING_WORK entry:
- The four SINGLE-LINE editors (attr value, directive header, hook chip,
  style entry) have exact `(file, line, col)` maps — they get LSP completion
  at the mapped position (buffer synthesized with the in-progress line) and
  the same colouring treatment.
- The two MULTILINE island editors stop being bare TextFields: they embed the
  existing CodeField control, inheriting its colouring, completion, overlay
  diagnostics and coloured-edit machinery instead of duplicating any of it.

Owner drive-through rounds (2026-08-16/17), both fixed same-day:
- Round 2 (`ecec78a0`): coloured-edit showed two scrollbars (listing scrollers
  now hidden while the input's inner ScrollView drives, styled dark); common
  C# keywords (void/int/bool/true/null/…) were plain outside Roslyn coverage
  (keyword regex widened, string cells protected); islands scrolled both axes
  with a stale horizontal offset clipping line heads (vertical-only + wrapping
  lines + MaxHeight 220 — deliberate POC divergence).
- Round 3, "the real gap in coloring still remains — look at all that white":
  identifiers/methods/types rendered plain ink in BOTH the source pane and
  every fragment. Root cause was two-layer: `ColorFor` painted
  Function/Variable #CFCFDA (indistinguishable from ink #D6D6DC) and
  Attribute/Property nothing, and the Roslyn merge drops "property name" +
  unresolved "identifier" spans while fragments get no tokens at all, so most
  identifiers had no colour source. Fix (CodeField only, no LSP change):
  real VS-dark palette in `ColorFor` (function gold #DCDCAA, member/variable
  blue #9CDCFE, type teal #4EC9B0, number green #B5CEA8) plus a lexical
  identifier/number pass in `BuildLineRichText` that claims only cells no
  token/string/{expr} run coloured — call sites gold, tag-position names via
  the schema split, dotted members + camelCase blue, PascalCase teal —
  keyword/comment passes still win. Covers pane, islands and all fragment
  editors deterministically; server tokens refine on top. `UNVERIFIED`.

### UB-26 follow-up — edge routing, how the field does it (owner question)

Node editors (Unreal Blueprints, Unity Shader Graph, Blender, dagre/ELK-based
web tools) mostly do NOT route around nodes — they make crossings rare and
cheap instead: (1) fixed ports (out-right, in-left) with horizontal-tangent
beziers — we already match; (2) LAYERED AUTO-LAYOUT: columns by dependency
depth with barycenter ordering to minimise crossings (dagre/ELK/Sugiyama —
our import graph is a DAG, ideal for it); (3) hover highlighting/dimming so
remaining crossings stop mattering; (4) optional user reroute pins. Proposal:
a "tidy layout" action running depth-column + barycenter over the graph
(persisted like manual drags), plus hover-highlight of a card's edges with
the rest dimmed. Routing AROUND cards (libavoid-style orthogonal routing) is
the heavyweight option none of the mainstream node editors actually use.

## 10. Field reports — owner drive-through, 2026-08-17

ALL IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-17 in one execution wave together with the UB-71..75
tail (owner: "execute everything that's remaining in the plan, the whole thing,
defer nothing"). Every item below is `UNVERIFIED` — gates green
(validate-uitkx 0, SG-backed csc smoke EXIT=0, machine-path clean, SG 1879/1879,
LSP 180/180, committed generator + language DLLs rebuilt Release), none of it
driven on screen yet. Notes per item record what shipped.

ONE MANUAL STEP OUTSTANDING (UB-75 palette half only): the embedded schema
reaches the builder through the LSP server, and the clone's builder resolves
`Server~/UitkxLanguageServer.dll` first (`RuitkDotnetLocator`). That file was
locked by the live server process of the running Unity session, so it still
carries the pre-UB-75 schema. With Unity closed, run:

```
dotnet publish ide-extensions~/lsp-server -c Release --self-contained false `
  -o "<embedded-clone-package-root>/Server~"
```

(the clone root is the one the embedded-clone sync procedure already uses —
never write it into a tracked file).

Nothing else waits on it — the repo copy under `ide-extensions~/vscode/server`
is already rebuilt and verified to embed all seven new elements, and the
false-UITKX0105 half of UB-75 is fixed builder-side by the registry union,
which needs no server at all.

### UB-77 — diagnostics console is not copyable `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

The error console/window (UITKX0105 storm in the capture) renders as plain
Labels: no selection, no Ctrl+A, no copy. Owner ask: make the whole console
selectable/copyable so all diagnostics can be selected and pasted elsewhere.
Likely shape: selectable text (UI Toolkit `selection`-enabled text element or
a read-only multiline field) plus an explicit "Copy all" affordance; Ctrl+A
inside the console must select console text only, not trigger canvas-wide
selection.

SHIPPED: the console is a vertical ScrollView holding a SELECTABLE Label with
the window's dark scroller chrome. The hard 4-line cap is gone — every
diagnostic line is in the text, so a copy cannot silently drop the tail.
Ctrl+A selects all and Ctrl+C copies, both scoped to the console element so
they never race the canvas or the source editor; right-click adds "Copy all
diagnostics" (disabled when empty). Also fixed en route: fragment mode set
`display = None` on the label and never restored it, so any CodeField instance
that had run a fragment recolor kept its console hidden forever — display is
now driven explicitly in both directions off the scroll container.

### UB-78 — component signature lines are not coloured `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

The card's signature block (name + full props signature under the title) is
one flat-grey Label while everything around it now colours. Route the
signature text through `CodeField.BuildLineRichText(line, null)` like islands
and detail entries already do — the UB-76-round-3 lexical pass then gives
types teal, parameter names blue, defaults (null/false/numbers) their real
colours for free. Watch rich-text vs. the signature's wrapping/ellipsis.

SHIPPED: `BuilderCanvasDrawing.SignatureRichText` now calls
`CodeField.BuildLineRichText(signature, null, boldPrefix)` instead of emitting
the parameter list RAW. The name keeps its bold via a new `boldPrefix` run
break (splitting at `(` BEFORE colouring would have robbed the name of the
paren that classifies it as a call, so the whole line is coloured once and the
run is broken at the paren). Required a classifier fix that helps everywhere:
`List<T>` was being read as markup because the identifier after `<` looked like
a tag — a `<` only opens a tag when the character before it is not an
identifier character, which is exactly what separates `<Label` from `List<`.

### UB-79 — raise the max zoom-OUT level `UNVERIFIED` `LOW`

Owner ask: allow zooming further out to see a bigger stretch of canvas. Pure
clamp change on the zoom range (plus verifying grid/edge/text rendering stays
sane at the new minimum scale); explicitly NOT a layout change.

SHIPPED: floor 0.30 -> `BuilderCanvasDrawing.ZoomMin` = 0.10 (a ~9x larger
visible area), ceiling unchanged as `ZoomMax` = 2.2. The range had been THREE
duplicated literal pairs (the canvas wheel handler, the host ctrl-wheel
handler, the persisted-layout clamp) that had to agree; they now share the one
pair. Card LOD already collapses to pills below 0.45, so nothing new renders at
the new floor.

### UB-80 — component list: double-click to focus a card `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

The palette's "custom components" section already lists every component on
the canvas. Owner ask: double-clicking a list entry focuses/centres that
card in the viewport (pan + sensible zoom, maybe a brief highlight pulse).
Note the double-click-navigation precedent: canvas rows already double-click
to navigate to a component's file — keep the two gestures consistent.

SHIPPED: `BuilderCanvasHost.FocusNode(path)` centres the camera on the card
(cam = viewportCentre - cardCentre * zoom, the same screen = world*zoom + cam
model the wheel handler anchors on) and moves the gold selection ring to it; a
card taller than the viewport pins near its top instead of centring, which
would otherwise scroll its title off-screen. `BuilderLibraryPane` entries carry
their node's FilePath and a double-click fires `FocusComponent` INSTEAD of
arming the drag, so the focused card is not also dropped somewhere on release.
All four workspace sections get it (components, style, hook and util modules),
not only components; schema natives have no file path and fall through to the
drag-arm unchanged.

Owner follow-up same day ("double clicking a custom component just place it in
view, it doesnt also fully zoom it which it should"): FocusNode is now a real
FRAME operation, not a pan. It solves the zoom so the card fills the viewport
(88% margin) and only then centres. Card width is LOD-dependent and LOD is
zoom-dependent, so the fit is solved twice - the second pass uses the width the
first pass's zoom implies, which converges because there are only three bands.
ZoomChanged fires so the toolbar layer readout and the scroller restyle track
it, exactly as the wheel and preset paths do.

### UB-81 — max zoom-IN gets slow, cause DIAGNOSED `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner report: at high zoom the canvas becomes sluggish. Diagnose before
fixing — candidate causes: every card/edge still rendered + hit-tested when
mostly off-screen (no viewport culling), rich-text label re-layout at scale,
edge bezier tessellation in generateVisualContent, dot-grid painting the full
element at fine pitch. Profile first (Editor profiler on the builder window),
name the dominant cost in the register, then fix at that layer.

DIAGNOSIS — read from the code, NOT from a profiler run (the Unity profiler
could not be driven from the implementing session; the owner should confirm the
win on screen). Dominant cost: **there was no viewport culling at all**.
`CanvasView` looped `graph.Nodes` unconditionally and built every card's full
subtree wherever it sat, and L2 is precisely where that explodes — each markup
row adds a flex wrapper plus THREE labels per attribute, each with pointer
callbacks, so the element count is roughly 4 x cards x rows x attributes and
none of it was bounded by what was on screen. That is why the slowdown tracks
zoom-IN (the L2 band, `zoom >= 1.05`) rather than the number of visible cards.
Ruled out on inspection: the dot grid is screen-space, fixed 26px pitch and
capped at 16000 quads, so it is zoom-invariant.

SHIPPED: cards more than one viewport outside the visible rect render as a
sized empty box instead of their sections (`BuilderCanvasDrawing.IsNearViewport`,
screen rect = world * zoom + camera, inflated one viewport on each side so a
pan never pops a card in at its edge). The box is deliberately KEPT rather than
dropping the element: the edge painter measures `card-{index}` and, when it
cannot find one, both guesses the geometry and schedules a 12-repaint retry
burst — and `CurrentZoom`'s setter resets that counter, so a dropped element
would have restarted the burst on every zoom step. Viewport size arrives as
`viewportW/H` props (pans and zooms recompute the cull inside the fiber from its
own camera state; only a RESIZE needs a push, wired on GeometryChangedEvent and
guarded on an actual size change). Card height for the placeholder and the cull
test comes from the graph layout's own `EstimateCardHeight`, now memoised per
node (`CachedHeight`, reset on re-parse) because the cull consults it for every
node on every render. A viewport that has not measured yet returns "near" —
a missing measurement must never hide content.

## 11. Field report — owner drive-through, 2026-08-17 round 2

Verdicts on the §10 wave: identifier colouring, the copyable console, signature
colouring, zoom-out, double-click focus and the zoom-in speed all confirmed on
screen. `UNVERIFIED` still: UB-72 and UB-75 (owner: "not sure how to test").
The rest produced this round, all fixed same-day.

### UB-82 — window shortcuts never fired: nothing was focusable `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "none of the keybind works" (UB-73 undo/redo) and "nothing get deleted"
(UB-74). One root cause for both, and it predates them: a `KeyDownEvent` is
dispatched to the FOCUSED element, `rootVisualElement` was not focusable, and
nothing in the canvas is — so `OnKeyDown` only ever ran while a TextField
happened to hold focus, which is precisely when the field wants the key for
itself. Ctrl+S/Ctrl+Z had the same hole since they were written. Worse, UB-74's
own "ignore this while typing" guard meant Delete could never fire at all: it
needed focus somewhere for the event to route, and bailed whenever that
somewhere was a text field.

FIX: the root is focusable and takes focus on any pointer-down whose TARGET is
not a typing surface. The decision reads the target, not the current focus, and
the handler is TrickleDown — canvas rows `StopPropagation` on pointer-down, so
a bubble-phase handler would never have seen the very clicks that select the
thing Delete acts on. `IsTypingSurface` is now one shared predicate for both
the focus grab and the OnKeyDown guard.

### UB-83 — every menu action no-ops on a card that was never opened `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "clicking on wrap with switch without selecting the component doesnt do
anything so no point even bring the menu up if its a must - i think it should
work regardless." Correct on both counts. A canvas card is parsed straight from
disk, so its rows, menus and drop targets all exist without a document session
— and every mutation began `_workspace.TryGet(path)`, which returns null for a
file the user has never opened, then silently returned. The menu was honest;
the action was not.

FIX: `EditSession(path)` = `TryGet ?? OpenSession`, opening on demand. Applied
to all 23 read-then-write sites (clause adds, wraps, deletes, line/tag edits,
indent and brace-matching helpers, `ApplyProgrammaticEdit`). Deliberately NOT
applied to `ReadBufferOrDisk` (its disk fallback is the point) or to
`ApplyLedgerWrites` (an undo must not resurrect a file that is no longer open).
Read-only sessions still refuse to mutate one layer down, where that decision
belongs.

### UB-84 — inline editor opened un-typable and narrower than its row `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "it doesnt focus that input, it should automatically focus it so you can
type right away" and "the input doesnt cover the entire selected item which
looks weird".

FIX (focus): the edit box is `display:none` until `SetEditing`, so it had no
layout in the tick where `Focus()` was called and the call was a silent no-op.
Focus is now retried on later ticks until `CodeField.EditorHasFocus` confirms
it took (8 attempts, 24 ms apart), which also survives a canvas re-render
landing between the open and the focus — exactly what a freshly seeded
directive header does.

FIX (width): the panel spanned the clicked BADGE. It now spans the row the
anchor belongs to (`row-{card}-{row}`, the same handle the drag hit-test walks
for), falling back to the anchor for non-row surfaces.

### UB-85 — a long page card panned but never zoomed `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "double clicking on showcaseDemoPage doesnt zoom it just pans - and it
seems like the only component where this happens". Not the root: the height.
UB-80's frame fitted BOTH axes, so a card with hundreds of markup rows solved
to `ZoomMin` — it did zoom, all the way out, which is indistinguishable from
not zooming.

FIX: fit WIDTH only. Card width is uniform per LOD, so the gesture now lands at
the same readable zoom for every card instead of one that swings with how much
markup a file happens to hold; a card taller than the viewport stays pinned
near its top, where its title is.

### UB-86 — source pane scrolled itself, and kept the offset across files `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "Right side code display scrolls both veriticle and horiznotal and in
random direction for no reason.. it should not be scroll unless the user does
and the scroll should reset when you select another component."

Two causes. `FocusLine` (row click -> source sync) used `ScrollView.ScrollTo`,
which moves BOTH axes to reveal the whole element — and a source row is as wide
as the longest line in the file, so revealing one row yanked the pane sideways
to a position nobody asked for. And `SetContent` never reset the offset, so
selecting another component showed it already scrolled to wherever the previous
file had been left.

FIX: `ScrollRowIntoView` adjusts the vertical offset only, leaves the
horizontal offset exactly where the user put it, and does nothing at all when
the row is already fully in view. `SetContent` resets the offset when the file
actually changes.

### UB-87 — Delete destroyed sample FILES off disk `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner, 2026-08-17: "the actual file got deleted the one i started the builder
with". Two files were lost from the embedded clone — `ShowcaseDemoPage.uitkx`
and `ShowcaseFieldsPanel.uitkx`, plus their metas. Both were restored with
`git restore` in the clone (it is a checkout; the repo copies were never
touched, which is why the repo showed no changes).

ROOT CAUSE, and it is mine — UB-74's `DeleteSelection` falls back to the CARD
selection when no row is selected, and deleting a card deletes a FILE. Three
things compounded:
1. The card selection is NEVER empty. `Mount` rings the focus file's card from
   the frame the window opens, so "no row selected" always resolved to "delete
   the file you just opened".
2. Deleting a row CLEARS the row selection. So two Delete presses in a row
   deleted an element and then the whole file.
3. There was no prompt. A menu click at least names the file it is about to
   delete; a keypress said nothing.

The owner's other symptom — "only showed 1 module even zoomed out max and no
connections, and i undo alot but didnt help" — is a consequence, not a separate
bug: the deleted root was the file that imports everything, and the ledger
holds BUFFERS, so no amount of undo could bring a file back.

FIX: the confirmation lives in `RequestDeleteCard`, the shared guard, so the
MENU path is covered too — a click is one slip away from the same loss. It is a
modal naming the file, and it says plainly that undo cannot reverse it. The
delete itself now uses `AssetDatabase.MoveAssetToTrash` rather than
`DeleteAsset`: same keystroke, but the file is recoverable afterwards.

SUPERSEDED SAME DAY by UB-88 - see below. The owner corrected the premise:
nothing may reach disk before Save at all, which dissolves the GUID problem
rather than working around it.

### UB-88 — deletion violated the save-only contract `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner, correcting UB-87's fix: "Nothing should be created or deleted or
anything, really applied until save is clicked, user can play with the builder
millions of times and years and unless they save.. everything get discarded..
so this whole thing doesnt apply."

Right, and it makes UB-87's GUID reasoning moot rather than a tradeoff to be
managed. `BuilderWorkspace` documents the save-only disk contract (VE-D2) in
its own class comment — "during editing nothing here writes" — and deletion was
the one operation that ignored it, calling `AssetDatabase` the instant it was
asked. That is why a keypress could destroy files the user never saved, and why
no amount of undo helped.

FIX: a deletion is a pending INTENT, like every other edit.
- `BuilderWorkspace` owns `_pendingDeletes` (serialized, so it survives a domain
  reload with the rest of the session). `MarkForDeletion` / `UnmarkForDeletion` /
  `IsPendingDelete`, and `HasUnsavedChanges` counts them.
- The card leaves the canvas immediately: `LoadTreeAsync` takes an `isHidden`
  predicate that drops the node and every edge touching it, wired to
  `IsPendingDelete`. The file itself is untouched.
- `SaveAll` performs the deletions in the same batch as the writes, via
  `MoveAssetToTrash`, then clears the list. `AbortAll` discards them.
- The ledger records deletions as `Change.IsDeletion`, so Ctrl+Z un-marks and
  Ctrl+Y re-marks. Nothing is re-created, so no GUID churns.
- The confirmation moved OFF the delete gesture and ONTO Save, which is the
  moment it stops being reversible; it lists every file by name and says they
  go to the trash.

### UB-89 — builder shortcuts leaked into Unity `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "i think ctrl+z and ctrol + shield + z.. and y also happened in the
window unity not just the ui tree.. which is also bad it should all be
contained within that window!!"

`StopPropagation()` ends UI Toolkit's own propagation but leaves the underlying
IMGUI event alive, so the Editor went on to run its GLOBAL Undo/Redo for the
same keystroke — mutating the scene behind the user while the builder undid a
buffer. Every builder shortcut had this, including Ctrl+S.

FIX: one `ConsumeKey` helper — `StopImmediatePropagation` + `PreventDefault` +
`imguiEvent.Use()`. Using the imgui event is the part that tells the Editor the
keystroke is spoken for.

### Provenance note — the six "modified" sample files were NOT builder writes

Owner: "no change should have happened, i changed nothing deliberately !! didnt
save one". Confirmed, and the builder is exonerated: all six files in the clone
are byte-identical to the repo working copy, and the repo's `Samples/` tree is
clean against its own HEAD. They read as modified only because the CLONE sits
on an older commit (`4ac0b2cd` vs the repo's tip) and was robocopy-synced from
the repo at some earlier point. Nothing to revert - the content is already the
committed content. Worth remembering when reading clone `git status`: it is a
deploy target, not a second checkout of the same commit.

## 12. Field report — owner drive-through, 2026-08-18 round 3

Dogfooding decision recorded: the canvas is a real `.uitkx` component, the
surrounding chrome is hand-built UI Toolkit C#. Owner: "for now let it stay,
later we will make 1 go at trying to convert it all to full or close to full
dogfooding". Not a defect - tracked as a future campaign, not in this wave.

Owner question answered: a tree with no persisted layout opens at zoom **1.0**
(`BuilderCanvasConfig.Zoom` defaults to 1f), which is LOD 1 - the 340px card
with signature, imports, hook chips and markup rows but no attributes or code
islands. A tree the user has opened before restores its saved zoom, clamped
into the live range on load.

### UB-90 — capabilities document + the skill that keeps it current `UNVERIFIED` `PROCESS`

Owner: a `plans/` document listing everything the builder can do, updated with
every capability change, "the reason for that is if we need to add that same
builder to the other project we will have something to go by". Needs the doc
AND a skill making the update mandatory, since a doc nobody is obliged to
touch rots within a wave.

### UB-91 — the loading state is invisible `UNVERIFIED` `LOW`

`ShowMessage("Loading tree…")` is a small dim label in the canvas's top-left.
Owner wants it centred and much larger, or a spinner in the middle.

### UB-92 — inline editor opens with the WINDOW unfocused `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

The UB-70 symptom is back and the real cause is finally identified: every menu
is a separate `EditorWindow` (`BuilderSearchMenu : EditorWindow`, `ShowPopup`).
When it closes after a pick, focus does NOT return to the builder - it lands on
whatever Unity had focused before, typically the Project window. So the inline
editor's `Focus()` succeeds INSIDE the builder's panel while the builder window
itself is not the focused window, and the keystroke goes elsewhere: Enter
reaches the Project window, which runs `OpenAsset`, which opens VS2022. The
focus-retry loop added in UB-84 cannot help, because the field it is focusing
is in an unfocused window. `BuilderSearchMenu` already records the invoking
window in `s_pointerWindow` for positioning - it just never focuses it back.

### UB-93 — wrap/edit commit semantics `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: after a wrap the header input must be focused and typable, with Escape
cancelling the whole addition, and Enter or clicking away committing. Escape
currently cancels the EDIT but leaves the seeded directive in the buffer, so
"cancel" does not undo the wrap that produced it.

### UB-94 — only markup rows are selectable/deletable `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "everything should be delitable, not just the footer part of the
component, hooks/ custom code.. etc.. i should be able to select and delete it
without right clicking and delete xyz." Needs selection to cover hook chips,
import rows, code-island lines and style/util export entries, each with a
delete that knows its own line range.

### UB-95 — flat wrap items should be one submenu `UNVERIFIED` `LOW`

Five sibling "Wrap in @x" rows crowd the row menu. Owner wants a single
"Wrap in…" opening a submenu of the directives.

### UB-96 — code islands render with wrapped, ugly formatting `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "our coloring is phenomenal - formatting is terrible". The island in
DISPLAY mode wraps long lines mid-expression; the source pane and the island's
own EDIT mode both look right. Self-inflicted: the round-2 fix for "islands
should scroll vertically only" set `CodeIslandLine` to `WhiteSpace = WsNormal`,
which stopped the horizontal scrolling by making every long line wrap. The ask
was about SCROLLING, not wrapping - the line should stay on one line and be
clipped at the card edge.

### UB-97 — focus selects the whole text `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: entering edit mode selects everything (immediately in an island, after
one extra click in the source pane). A field that selects-all on focus means
the first keystroke destroys the content.

### UB-98 — edit-mode scrollbar sits inside the text `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

The coloured-edit overlay's scroller is inset from the right edge, overlapping
the text instead of riding the boundary.

### UB-99 — inline editor mismatches the row at non-default zoom `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

The overlay is unscaled window chrome positioned over a SCALED canvas row, so
at high zoom the highlighted row is large while the editor keeps its 12px font
and 30px height - "the selected wrap is big and the input is ugly".

### UB-100 — attribute editors do not auto-focus `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Same root as UB-92: clicking an attribute value opens the editor without the
keyboard, so the user must click again before typing.


All of UB-90..UB-100 implemented 2026-08-18 in one wave; gates green
(validate-uitkx 0, SG-backed csc smoke EXIT=0, machine-path clean). Key
implementation notes:
- UB-92 is the ACTUAL fix for the long-standing UB-70 "Enter opens VS2022":
  `BuilderSearchMenu.CloseAndRestoreFocus` focuses the invoking window before
  running the pick, and the invoker is captured at Place() time rather than
  relying on the positioning-only `s_pointerWindow`. The overlay also calls
  `BuilderWindow.FocusExisting` before focusing its field.
- UB-94 adds a second selection channel, `onLineSelect(path, from, to, label)`,
  mirrored on the host beside the row selection; selecting either kind clears
  the other. Wired to hook chips, import rows, code islands and style entries;
  Delete routes the range through the same DeleteLinesInFile primitive.
- UB-96 reverses the round-2 `WsNormal` island change: the ask then was about
  SCROLLING, and wrapping was the wrong lever. Islands keep vertical-only
  scrolling and clip instead.
- UB-99 scales the inline editor from the anchor's worldBound height, so no
  zoom value needs threading into the overlay.

## 13. Field report — owner drive-through, 2026-08-18 round 4

Owner confirmed fixed this round: the code islands now colour (UB-76 wave).
Everything below was raised in the same message and fixed same-day.

### UB-101 — island editor floats instead of replacing the island `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "the body code input doesnt match the size (as if its outside island) -
maybe we should replace in place the display mode to edit mode same size and
everything." The multiline branch ignored the anchor's measured size and used a
fixed 140-380 band plus a +24 pad, so the editor opened as a different-sized
box overlapping its own island. It now takes the anchor's exact worldBound for
both position and size, with the 3px lift suppressed for multiline.

### UB-102 — a selected chip or island showed no selection `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "when you click 1 time on the field it should be orange selected to
demonstrate that its selected". UB-94 made these things selectable but only the
import rows got a highlight. Hook chips now take the warm band plus the accent
outline, and islands get a `CodeIslandSelected` style — the same signal a
selected markup row uses, so "this is what Delete removes" reads identically
everywhere.

### UB-103 — edges leave a card from the middle of its content `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "the linking points are in bad position, they should be right top most
of each component." The SOURCE end of every edge sat at the import or markup row
that produced it, so at L2 on a tall card the endpoint was far down the card and
the curve ran back across its own content. Edges now leave from the card's
TOP-RIGHT corner (`SourceTopRight`), incoming still arrive at the top-left.
CORRECTED same day. Moving the curve while leaving the DOTS on their rows
orphaned them - the owner's next look was "where are their lines ?", with dots
beside rows and no line touching any of them. A dot and its curve are one
thing and must share a point. The source is the row's dot again, and the
original complaint is answered by the POSITION instead: both the dot and the
curve now sit ON the card's right border (`RowAnchorFallback`) rather than
16px inside it, so an edge leaves at the card edge instead of starting over
its own content. Lesson recorded: an anchor GLYPH and the geometry it
represents must be computed from one expression, never two.

### UB-104 — setState during render, every frame the host pushed `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

`[Hooks][Strict] State update scheduled during render` at CanvasView.uitkx:63.
Real, and ours: the host pushes selection and camera as version bumps, and the
component applied them by calling `setSelected`/`setZoom`/`setCamX`/`setCamY`
in the render body. The render now DERIVES the incoming value for the current
pass and a `useEffect` keyed on the version commits it for later ones — the
shape React's "adjusting state on a prop change" guidance describes. This is
also the most likely source of the "it broke at some point" render corruption
seen in round 2, since a set during render re-enters the reconciler mid-pass.

### UB-105 — obsolete PreventDefault (CS0618) `UNVERIFIED` `LOW`

Two sites. `EventBase.PreventDefault` is obsolete in Unity 6; it was also
redundant, since consuming the underlying IMGUI event is what actually stops
the Editor acting on the keystroke. Both now use
`StopImmediatePropagation` + `imguiEvent.Use()`.

### UB-106 — inline editor clipped its own text `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "the textfield is cut off (maybe font size too big, or too big of
padding)". Both, and self-inflicted by UB-99: the font was scaled to the row
height but the box was sized without accounting for the input's 8px vertical
padding pair and Gutter-wide sides. Fragment editors now use compact chrome
(2px vertical, 6px sides) and the box is sized FROM the chosen font
(`font * 1.65 + 8`) rather than the other way round.

### Still outstanding — clone LSP publish

The schema-drift warning naming Vector2Field and friends is the pre-UB-75
server still running: `Server~/UitkxLanguageServer.dll` in the clone remains
locked by two live `.NET Host` processes. Publish it with Unity closed; nothing
else waits on it.

## 14. Field report — owner drive-through, 2026-08-18 round 5

Owner convention from here: "If i didnt mention a feature consider it success,
I will only report failures." Unreported items in a wave are CLOSED.

### UB-107 — anchor dots sat on top of the code `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "either we have lines and the points are in wrong place, or the points
are in right place but we dont have lines? what i want is for the points/dots
to be on the right side, but still have lines."

Both halves were the same bug seen from two sides. `AnchorOf` returns the
marker ELEMENT's centre, and the marker is laid out after the row's attribute
run — so on a long L2 row it sits in the middle of the code, and both the dot
and its curve started from there. UB-103's first attempt then moved the curve
to the card corner and left the dot behind, which orphaned it.

FIX: `RowAnchor` keeps the marker's measured Y (so it still tracks its row and
the section's scroll clamp) and pins X to the card's right BORDER. Every dot
lands in one clean column on the card edge, each on its own row, with its line
attached. One expression feeds both the dot and the curve.

### UB-108 — closing an inline editor dropped window focus `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "right click, wrap in, foreach, enter - loses focus, ctrl z goes on
unity, - same with any other directive", and the same after Escape. Closing the
editor destroys the focused element and Unity hands the keyboard to no one, so
the builder stops being the focused window and the next Ctrl+Z ran UNITY's
undo. UB-92 fixed focus on the way IN; this is the way OUT.

FIX: `RemovePanel` — the single exit path for commit, cancel and blur — calls
`BuilderWindow.FocusExisting`, then re-focuses the window ROOT on the next tick
(a KeyDownEvent needs a focused ELEMENT, not just a focused window).

### UB-109 — sibling drop hint was too faint to read `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "i just tried for several attempt to drop the label between the 2
visualElements and it failed every time or at least i thought it did, but it
didnt". The drop was landing correctly — `AfterAnchor` already uses the row's
whole-block `EndLine` — but a 2px accent rule at the row boundary was too easy
to miss, so a correct drop read as a failed one.

FIX: a sibling insert paints a thick DASHED rule with end caps at the exact
line the element will land on, clearly distinct from the tinted box that means
"nest inside". Dash and cap sizes divide by the live zoom so the caret is the
same weight at every LOD.

### UB-110 — the drop caret pointed at a different place than the drop `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "i see the dotted line and it drops it on the first visualElement as if
there can be 2 right positions". Exactly that — there were two.

The canvas lists markup FLATTENED with indentation, so the row element for
`<VisualElement style={safeStyle}>` is only its OPEN TAG line, and the gap
drawn under it is visually the gap before its FIRST CHILD. But the "after"
band inserted at `AfterAnchor`, which is the row's whole-block `EndLine` —
past every descendant, hundreds of lines below on a deep tree. The caret and
the edit were reading the same gesture in two different coordinate systems, so
UB-109's clearer caret made the mismatch obvious rather than causing it.

FIX, and it is the model the owner described: the caret is a POSITION IN THE
LISTED TREE, and the edit lands there.
- Hovering a row (middle band) appends INSIDE it, at the end. Unchanged.
- The gap under a row whose next listed row is DEEPER means "become that row's
  first child" — `InsertFirstChildTag`, inserting under the open tag (which
  `OpenTagEndLine` finds, so a multi-line attribute run is handled).
- The gap under a row whose next listed row is a sibling or shallower still
  means "after this row's block", which is the same point visually.
- The top band still means "before this row", as a sibling.

Applied to BOTH the insert path and the move path, so dragging a new element
and relocating an existing one read the caret identically. A self-closing
target has no inside to be first in, so it falls back to the append path that
rewrites `/>` into an open/close pair.

## 15. Creation flow — save-gated, 2026-08-18

Raised while auditing the create path before the owner drove it.

### UB-111 — creation wrote to disk immediately `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

`BuilderNewFileDialog.Create` called `File.WriteAllText` + `AssetDatabase.Refresh`
the moment the name prompt was confirmed. Same class as UB-88 on the other
side: the owner's rule is "nothing should be created/update/deleted anything on
files until save". A created file survived Abort, survived closing without
saving, and Ctrl+Z could not remove it.

Why it was written that way, and the real work in fixing it: the canvas cards
come from the LSP module graph, which is built from files on DISK, so a module
that exists only as a buffer has no node and would show no card at all.

FIX:
- `BuilderNewFileDialog` no longer touches disk. It answers two questions —
  `PathFor` and `TemplateFor`.
- The window opens a never-saved session (`BuilderWorkspace.CreateNew`, which
  already existed and had NO callers — the save-gated path was half-built) and
  records a ledger entry.
- `BuilderCanvasHost.AppendPendingNewNodes` synthesises a node per pending new
  module after the graph loads and fills it through the same
  `PopulateCardDetail` every other card uses, so a never-saved module is a real
  card with real parsed content.
- `SaveAll` writes it (creating the folder chain) and then calls
  `AssetDatabase.Refresh` OUTSIDE the reload suppressor, since a plain
  `File.WriteAllText` leaves no `.meta` and Unity would not see the asset.
- `AbortAll` already dropped never-saved sessions; `DiscardNew` lets undo do
  the same for one file, and redo re-opens it from the text kept on the entry.

### UB-112 — new modules landed flat, with invented exports `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Two owner corrections in one:

FOLDER LAYOUT — files were created beside the focus file. The house layout puts
a component in its OWN folder and nests children under `components/`:
```
ComponentName/
    ComponentName.uitkx
    ComponentName.style.uitkx
    components/
        SubComponent/
            SubComponent.uitkx
```
`PathFor` now sends a new COMPONENT to `<focusDir>/components/<Name>/<Name>.uitkx`
and a style/hook/util module beside the component it belongs to. Suffixes are
unchanged (`.style.uitkx`, `.hooks.uitkx`, plain `.uitkx`): the builder detects
module KIND from them (`ClassifyByPathAndExports`) and every existing sample
uses them, so the owner's shorthand `.hook.uitkx` / `.util.uitkx` was read as
the established convention rather than a rename.

TEMPLATES — "we should only export what the user add". The old templates
invented members nobody asked for: `nameRoot` for a style, `nameText` for a
util, plus a counter body and a decorative `<Label>` for a component. Now a
style and a util module start EMPTY (their exports are named one at a time
through the card's own affordances), and a component and a hook emit exactly
the export the user just named, with the smallest legal body. NOTE for the
owner: a hook must return something, so `useX` still emits one `useState` —
that is the smallest thing that IS a hook, and the only invention left.

### UB-113 — the menu item opened a dead end `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "i just clicked on our reactiveUiToolkit -> Ui Builder. and its empty,
how do i even start ? theres no new no nothing, pointless to have that menu
item if we cannot do anythig with it."

Correct — `MountCanvas` returned immediately with no focus file, so the window
mounted nothing and its only hint pointed back at the Project window. Every
create path also required a focus file to derive a folder from, so "+ new" and
the canvas right-click both refused with "Open a tree first".

FIX, following the owner's proposal exactly:
- An EMPTY STATE is now the way in: a centred "Start a UI" panel with the four
  module kinds, the reassurance that nothing is written until Save, and the
  right-click route for an existing tree.
- `CreateModule` no longer needs a tree. With one open, a module lands relative
  to the focus file as before. With none, it lands under a provisional root
  that exists only in memory, and the first COMPONENT owns its own folder
  rather than nesting under a `components/` directory with nothing above it.
- Save is where an unrooted tree gets a home: `ResolveUnsavedLocation` asks for
  a folder (starting at the project root), refuses one outside the project
  because a `.uitkx` there is never compiled, refuses to clobber existing
  files, relocates every pending session with `BuilderWorkspace.Relocate`, and
  only then writes. Cancelling the folder prompt cancels the save with nothing
  written. The canvas remounts afterwards, since the tree now lives at a
  different path than the graph was built from.

Note on the provisional root: it sits under `Assets/` rather than the temp
directory because `IsReadOnlyLocation` treats everything outside the project as
immutable — a temp path would have opened the first card READ-ONLY and refused
every edit. Nothing is ever written there; Save relocates first or does not
write at all.

## 16. Field report — building a component from zero, 2026-08-19

### UB-114 — a card froze whenever a re-parse threw `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "When i added a button it automatically added a text attribute but only
in the right side component code, in the card the attribute didnt show until i
tried to add another attribute."

`BuilderCanvasHost.RefreshGraph` wrapped `PopulateCardDetail` in a try/catch
whose catch RETURNED — skipping `RenderCanvas`. So any edit whose re-parse
threw (routine while a buffer is half-typed) left the card showing its previous
content, and the change only appeared when a LATER edit happened to parse
cleanly, which is why two edits arrived together. The catch now swallows and
falls through to the redraw: the node keeps whatever it managed to populate,
and a broken buffer is reported by diagnostics rather than by a frozen card.

### UB-115 — the value editor nested its own wrapper `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "when editing a field it adds "" automatically which makes {value} turn
into "{value}"." The attribute editors deliberately keep the quotes or braces
OUTSIDE the field, so a value typed with braces got wrapped again and became a
literal brace string. Typing a value the user wrapped themselves now switches
the attribute's FORM: `{…}` makes it an expression, `"…"` makes it a string
literal. Both directions, so an expression slot accepts a quoted literal too.

### UB-116 — canvas edits were never formatted `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "the formatting of the text doesnt work there and it should happened
when you type and when you save and if both is too much so just when you save."
Canvas edits splice LINES into the buffer, so an inserted tag carried whatever
indent the splice guessed. Save now runs every dirty buffer through the same
AST formatter the source pane's apply uses, recording the result in the ledger
so it is undoable. Chosen deliberately: format on SAVE only, not per keystroke
— the formatter is a whole-file reprint and would fight the caret while typing.
A buffer that does not format cleanly is left EXACTLY as it was, since the
formatter's non-Formatted outcomes are data-loss guards, not results.

### UB-117 — no way to add body code except the source pane `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "The only way to add custom logic / code in body of component is editing
the text on right sidebar. we should add a button like the + hook so + code."
Added beside "+ hook" on component and hook cards. It rides the same path — the
body is one list of statement lines and a hook call is just one of them — so it
seeds a statement, opens the inline editor on it, and is undoable like any
other edit.

### Not a builder defect — `event` as a lambda parameter

The CS1525 storm in the owner's capture comes from `onClick={event => …}`:
`event` is a reserved C# keyword and cannot name a lambda parameter. The
diagnostics reported it correctly. Worth noting only because the cascade
(CS1002/CS1031/CS1055/CS0065 …) reads like a builder failure and is not one.

### UB-118/119 — an unsaved tree reached disk anyway `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner: "Why this file exist if i discarded and never saved?" It existed at
`Assets/__RuitkBuilderUnsaved__/SomeComponent/SomeComponent.uitkx`, with a
`.meta`, so Unity had imported it. Two independent defects, either of which was
enough on its own.

UB-118 — `SaveChanges()`, the override UNITY calls from its own prompt (closing
the window, a domain reload, entering play mode), went straight to
`_workspace.SaveAll()`. That bypassed the window's SaveAll completely: no
location prompt, no format pass. So the user never pressed Save — Unity did, on
their behalf, through a door that skipped every guard. It now routes through
the same SaveAll the toolbar uses and, if the location prompt is cancelled,
leaves the window dirty rather than reporting a save that did not happen.

UB-119 — even the window's own SaveAll would have written it. `UnsavedRoot` was
built with `Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, …)`, and `Application.dataPath`
returns FORWARD slashes on Windows while Combine only inserts a separator
without rewriting the ones already there. The root therefore kept forward
slashes in its prefix while every session path had been through
`Path.GetFullPath` and was all backslashes, so the `StartsWith` prefix test
never matched, `pending` came back empty, and the relocation was skipped.

FIX, in three layers so no single comparison carries the invariant:
1. Both sides of the test are `GetFullPath`-normalised.
2. `BuilderDocumentSession.NeedsLocation` marks a module whose path is
   provisional, and `BuilderWorkspace.SaveAll` REFUSES to write one — whoever
   calls it, however the paths compare. `Relocate` clears the flag.
3. `SaveChanges` shares the window's save path.

CORRECTION — the leftover folder was NOT inert, as first reported. It sat in
Assets/, so Unity imported it and the source generator compiled it: after a
Reimport All the whole project failed on its single bad token (CS0065), and the
failure cascaded into Mono.Cecil assembly-resolution errors for
Assembly-CSharp-Editor across Burst. It was deleted, and UB-120 makes a repeat
harmless.

### UB-120 — the provisional root was visible to Unity `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

The in-memory root lived at a normal folder name under Assets, so anything that
reached it became a REAL asset. The folder now ends in '~', which the Asset
Database ignores wholesale: a future leak cannot be imported, cannot get a
.meta, and cannot be compiled. Defence in depth behind UB-119 rather than a
replacement for it.

Lesson worth keeping: a save-only contract cannot be enforced by a string
comparison at one call site, because the framework has its own save door.

## 17. Field report — wiring a style module, 2026-08-19

### UB-121 — an import to an unsaved module drew a dot but no line `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "even when connected no pint line, just dots." Edges came ONLY from the
language server's module graph, which is built from files on DISK, so an import
pointing at a module that is still an unsaved buffer produced no edge at all.
The anchor DOTS are painted per import ROW, independently, which is exactly why
one appeared without the other. `AppendMissingImportEdges` now resolves every
relative import specifier against the nodes on the canvas and adds any edge the
server did not know about — so a brand-new style module wires up immediately,
and the dot always has its line.

### UB-122 — menus were mouse-only `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "the menus doesnt have up / down for navigating them." Arrow keys now
move a highlight through the pickable rows (headers and separators skipped) and
Enter takes it; the list scrolls to follow. Typing refilters and resets the
highlight to "first match", which is what Enter always did.

### UB-123 — an import's binding name was unreachable text `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "we cannot copy the name of the variable in the import so either make it
copyable, or make it autocomplete in fields." Double-clicking an import row now
copies just the BINDING — `BuilderText.ImportAliasOf` reads the three shapes the
language allows (`* as Alias`, `{ A, B }`, a bare default) — not the specifier
or the import chrome, since the binding is the only part a reference has to
spell.

### Answered, not defects

- "Why is the component not visible / shows nothing on the right" — a preview
  needs a compiled TYPE, and a module that has never been saved has never been
  compiled, so there is nothing to instantiate. The pane already says so. This
  is inherent to save-gating, not a regression: save once and previews work
  from then on.
- "How do I connect a new style to the component" — dragging the style module
  from the library onto the CARD already adds the import (`stylemod` drop,
  guarded to components). The menu is not the only route; the gesture the owner
  proposed is the one that exists.

### Deferred with a reason

- Renaming a module — REMAINING_WORK UB-124. It is a cross-file refactor
  (export, file, folder, and every importer's specifier and binding), not a
  menu item.
- An apostrophe in a `//` comment inside a `{…}` attribute expression breaks
  SOURCE GENERATION while parsing clean — REMAINING_WORK SG-APOSTROPHE. Found
  while editing CanvasView; minimal repro recorded. It affects any .uitkx
  author, not just the builder.

## 18. Rename, and a selection regression, 2026-08-19

### UB-124 — rename a module `UNVERIFIED` `FEATURE`

Owner: "all component should have an option to renaim them" — and, on the
scope: "yes that make sense." Implemented as a real refactor rather than a
menu item, because a rename is FOUR edits that must land together or not at
all:
1. the EXPORT the module declares (`RenameExportIn` rewrites the declaration
   only — a word-boundary sweep over the file would rewrite unrelated
   identifiers that merely share the name);
2. every IMPORTER's specifier AND binding, plus that binding's uses
   (`RenameReferencesIn` — the two move together, since renaming either alone
   leaves the file pointing at something that no longer exists);
3. the FILE name;
4. the FOLDER, when the module owns one (the house layout for components), so
   the folder can never contradict the file.

All of it is pending buffer work: `BuilderWorkspace.Rename` relocates a
never-saved module outright, and expresses a SAVED one with the two pending
mechanisms that already exist — a new session carrying the text at the new
path plus a deletion mark on the old. Save writes the new file and trashes the
old in one batch; Abort drops both. The whole rename is ONE ledger entry
including the creation and the deletion, so a single Ctrl+Z puts the module
back where it was. Name validation reuses the create-prompt rules via
`KindKeyOf`, so a rename cannot produce a name creation would have refused.

### UB-126 — menu keys existed only where a search field did `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "not fixed in all menus, new component menu doesnt have those keys."
Correct, and the previous fix was the shallow one: the arrow/Enter handling was
bound to the SEARCH FIELD, so every menu built without one — the create menu
and every simple pick list — stayed mouse-only. The keys now live in a single
`OnListKeyDown` shared by both menu shapes, bound to the root for the
non-searchable case with the root taking focus so they arrive at all.

### UB-127 — the hook editor clipped its own line `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

A hook chip is only as wide as its summary ("useState -> value, setValue"), but
the line it edits is the full declaration. A single-line editor now takes the
width of the CARD SECTION it sits in when that is wider than the thing clicked.

### UB-128 — selection highlight covered half the line `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner: "the text select only marks half of the text." A regression from the
compact chrome added for UB-106/127. The coloured-edit overlay only registers
while the INPUT and the LISTING share identical text geometry, and compact mode
moved the input to a 2px vertical band while leaving the listing on the source
pane's 8px one. The selection highlight is drawn by the input, the glyphs the
user sees are the listing, so the band sat several pixels off the text. Both
surfaces are now driven from one pair of constants, and the row builder reads
the same pair, so they cannot diverge again.

## 19. Rename fallout, 2026-08-19 — four defects, three of them mine

### UB-129 — the rename prompt could not be edited `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "it shows the original name but it doesnt allow you to select part of it
or all of it... typing any letter just clears the entire value." Exactly right,
and a call-site blunder: `ShowNamePrompt` takes a PLACEHOLDER, and I passed the
current name as one. A placeholder is grey hint text drawn over an EMPTY field —
there is nothing to select and the first keystroke is simply the first
character. The prompt now takes an `initialValue` distinct from the
placeholder, seeds the field with it, and selects it on open, so a rename can
be edited or replaced wholesale.

### UB-130 — an undo chord inside a prompt hit Unity `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "if while editing the name you mistakenly ctrl + z it applies to unity."
The prompt is its own EditorWindow and never claimed the chord, so it fell
through to Unity's global undo and mutated the scene. UB-89 fixed this for the
builder window; the popups were a second, unfixed door. The name field now
consumes Ctrl+Z/Y for the life of the prompt.

### UB-131 — undoing a rename blanked the window `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner: "after the change i ctrl Z and [the card and source pane are empty]".
Two compounding faults in the replay:
1. Undoing a rename DISCARDS the renamed module's session, but `_focusFile`
   still named it — so every pane rendered emptiness over a tree that was
   perfectly intact, and the card had no content because the graph had no such
   node.
2. `ApplyLedgerWrites` remounted the canvas BEFORE writing the buffers and
   before validating the focus, so the whole window was rebuilt around a file
   that no longer existed.

Fixed by ordering the replay the way it should always have been: every model
change lands FIRST, then the focus is validated (`RebindFocusIfMissing` moves
to any live, non-deleted session), then the views refresh exactly once.

### UB-132 — a pending module in a non-existent folder broke the preview `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner: "everything broke... its extremely slow to type in", with
`DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path ...\SomeBodyThat`.
NOT a rename bug — a hole in the save-gated design that rename merely exposed
hard. Two companion scans in `UitkxHmrCompiler` call `Directory.GetFiles(dir)`
unguarded, and a module the builder holds as a pending buffer can legitimately
sit in a directory that does not exist yet: a new component owns a fresh folder,
and so does a rename. The exception killed the preview compile and, because the
compile is debounced per keystroke, threw on every character — which is the
typing slowness. An absent directory HAS no companions; that is an answer, not
a failure, and both scans now say so. The same exception was visible in the
CREATE flow days earlier and was misread as noise.

Gates: SG 1879/1879 (including the Hmr parity contracts, since this touched
`Editor/HMR/`), csc smoke EXIT=0, validate-uitkx 0, machine-path clean.

### UB-133 — renaming the root collapsed the whole tree `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner renamed ShowcaseDemoPage to BhowcaseDemoPage and the canvas went from the
full tree (seven-plus cards, every usage edge) to TWO cards.

ROOT CAUSE, and it is the same hole as UB-132 seen from the graph side: the
canvas adjacency is built ONLY from the language server's edge list, which is
derived from files on DISK. A renamed module is a PENDING buffer at a path the
server has never seen, and the old path is hidden as a pending delete, so its
edges are filtered out too. `ConnectedComponent` therefore found nothing
attached to the focus file, `member` came back as just that one file, and every
other module dropped out of the graph. `AppendPendingNewNodes` had added the
node itself, and `AppendMissingImportEdges` could only draw edges BETWEEN nodes
that were already there — which is why exactly one neighbour survived.

FIX at the layer the fault lives: `LoadTreeAsync` now takes the pending set and
`LinkPendingImports` parses each pending buffer's own import directives,
resolves the specifiers, and feeds them into the adjacency BEFORE the
reachability walk. The walk then sees the tree the user is actually looking at,
whether or not the server knows the file exists. A specifier that resolves to
nothing is skipped, so a half-typed import cannot break the tree.

This also fixes the same collapse for a NEWLY CREATED component that imports
existing modules — it was always latent there; rename just made it obvious.

### UB-134 — a rename destroyed the module it renamed `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Found while doing the project-model refactor (`Plans~/BUILDER_MODEL_REFACTOR.md`,
Stage 1) rather than from a report, but it is a real defect with three separate
symptoms.

ROOT CAUSE: `BuilderWorkspace.Rename` expressed a move as a fresh session at the
new path plus a deletion mark on the old one. The session object IS the module -
it carries the undo history and the recorded line-ending flavour - so renaming a
module silently threw both away: the user's undo stack for that file was gone,
and a file that had been CRLF on disk would be rewritten LF at Save. The ledger
recorded the same rename as an unrelated creation and deletion, which is why
undoing it could put the module back without its history.

FIX: identity now lives on the session (`Id`), and where the module lives on
disk is recorded separately (`OriginalDiskPath`). A rename re-files the SAME
session under a new path; the two fields disagreeing is precisely what a pending
move is, and `Save` projects it as one operation - write the new file, retire the
old - instead of inferring it from a create/delete pair. `AbortAll` points the
path back. The ledger gained one `IsMove` change kind, so undo and redo walk the
move rather than re-creating the module.

Two further defects fell out of the same work:

- `BuilderDocumentSession.Open` was also used for paths with NO file behind them
  (the workspace opens a missing file with an empty buffer). Such a session would
  have claimed a disk origin it did not have, so `Save` would write the file
  without setting `createdAssets`, skip `AssetDatabase.Refresh`, and leave a
  `.uitkx` on disk that Unity never imports or compiles - the UB-111 failure
  again, from the other end. `Open` now takes the existence the caller already
  computed.
- The canvas hid a renamed module's old path only because the rename marked it
  for deletion. With the move expressed properly there is no deletion mark, so
  the disk-derived graph would have shown a ghost card at the old name and none
  at the new one. `IsHiddenOnDisk` now owns both facts - marked for deletion, or
  vacated by a move - and `PendingNewFiles` yields a moved module's new path,
  which has no file behind it yet.

Verified by compiling the builder editor assembly against the 6000.5.6f1
reference set: 0 errors.

### UB-135 — renaming a folder-owning component orphaned its children `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

The bug the owner hit from two sides and the reason for the project-model
refactor. Renaming a component that owns its folder moved ONLY its own file:
`Showcase/Showcase.uitkx` became `Bowcase/Bowcase.uitkx` while
`Showcase/components/Sub/Sub.uitkx` stayed exactly where it was. The parent's
own import then read `./components/Sub/Sub` relative to `Bowcase/`, where
nothing existed, so every sub-component silently detached.

ROOT CAUSE: the rename computed a new folder path but nothing ever moved the
folder. Only the module's file was expressed as a pending change, so the
children were never part of the operation at all.

FIX, at the layer the fault lives: a folder-owning rename is now a FOLDER move.
Every module inside the folder is brought into the model first, the folder is
recorded as a pending move like every other edit, and Save projects it as ONE
`AssetDatabase.MoveAsset`. That matters beyond tidiness: moving the children
one file at a time would write each anew and trash the original, churning every
child GUID and stranding everything in the folder the builder does not manage -
companion `.cs`, `.uss`, nested folders. Because the folder keeps its depth,
every relative import inside the subtree, and every one pointing out of it,
stays correct without being touched; imports from OUTSIDE into the subtree are
rewritten by the existing reference pass.

Two further defects fixed in the same pass:

- Importers that were not already OPEN were skipped. Step 2 of the rename used
  `TryGet` rather than `EditSession`, so any importer the user had not visited
  kept pointing at the module's old name. A rename has to reach every importer,
  not just the visited ones.
- A folder that is not on disk is no longer queued for a move. Renaming a
  module the user had only just created would otherwise have queued a move of a
  directory that was never written, and the whole Save would have failed on it.

### UB-136 — the canvas learned about buffers three separate times `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Not a new report; the shape behind UB-111, UB-121 and UB-133. The module graph
came from the language server, which reads DISK, so anything the builder held
as a buffer had no edges - and each symptom got its own patch:
`AppendPendingNewNodes`, `AppendMissingImportEdges`, `LinkPendingImports`.
Three patches teaching three consumers the same fact is the signature of a
missing owner.

FIX: the graph's structure now comes from the modules themselves. The server's
answer is treated as what it actually is - a CACHE of the disk state, derived
from the same text - and is used for any module the builder has not touched,
which keeps the cost where it was; for a module the builder holds differently,
created, renamed or merely edited, the server is stale by definition and that
module's own text is parsed instead. All three patches are deleted.

The three duplicate specifier resolvers went with them. The builder had one in
the canvas host, one in the graph service and one in the preview compiler, each
probing a different set of filename suffixes - which is why the same import
could resolve in one place and not another - while the language's own
`ImportResolver` sat unused. There is now one resolver, shared by the edges the
canvas draws and the order the preview compiles in, and it needed no suffix
probing at all: a style module is imported as `./Thing.style`, and the resolver
appends `.uitkx` to exactly that.

Also fixed here, found while tracing the same seam: `SyncLspBuffer` gated its
`didOpen` on `open && _lspOpened.Add(path)`. `&&` short-circuits, so a file
first synced by an EDIT rather than by a mount never entered the set and then
received `didChange` forever for a document the server had never been told
about. A rename makes that routine, since the module arrives at a path nothing
has opened. A document is now opened before it is changed.

### UB-139 — UXML import wrote to disk immediately `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Both import entry points - the toolbar's "Import .uxml..." and the asset-menu
"Convert UXML to UITKX" - called `File.WriteAllText` and `AssetDatabase.Refresh`
the moment the conversion finished, which is precisely the save-only contract
(VE-D2) the rest of the builder obeys and the one the owner asked for in these
words: nothing should be created, updated or deleted on disk until Save.

A conversion produces a MODULE, not a file. Both paths now hand the builder a
pending buffer - the asset-menu one through a new `OpenFor(path, pendingText)`
overload - so Save writes it, Abort drops it, and Ctrl+Z takes it back like any
other creation.

### UB-140 — the canvas layout was thrown away by a rename `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Arrange the cards, rename a component, and the layout resets to the default
fan-out.

ROOT CAUSE: `BuilderCanvasConfig` names its file after a SHA-1 of the tree
ROOT's full path and keys each card position by a path relative to that root.
A rename changes member paths and, for the root or a folder-owning component,
the file name too - so `LoadForRoot` missed and the by-member scan missed as
well, because every member path had just changed. The layout was never
corrupted, only unreachable, and the next save wrote a fresh config under the
new key while the old one was left behind forever.

FIX: the rename tells the layout where it went. `Repath(old, new, isFolder)`
resolves every stored key back to an absolute path, moves it, and re-keys it
against the new root; the config the tree has outgrown is deleted on the next
save rather than orphaned. It is called for the folder move and the file move,
and for both directions of undo and redo, so the layout follows a rename out
and back.

Worth recording why the obvious approach was NOT taken: keying positions by
`BuilderDocumentSession.Id` looks right and is wrong. That id is stable within a
session and across domain reloads, but a fresh window generates new ones, so
identity-keyed layout would have survived renames and lost everything BETWEEN
sessions - trading a visible annoyance for a worse invisible one.

### UB-141 — a history jump moved the text but not the tree `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Clicking an entry in the History panel replayed only buffer writes. Structural
changes - a creation, a deletion, a module move, a folder move - carry paths
rather than text in their Before/After, so they were skipped; feeding them to
the write path handed null to `ApplyEdit`, which rejects it. A jump across a
rename therefore moved the text while leaving the module where it was.

FIX at the layer the fault lives: the per-entry replay is now one method,
`ApplyEntry(entry, undo, writes)`, and undo, redo and the history jump all go
through it. A jump is simply N undos or N redos, so every change kind is
honoured; buffer writes are still collected across the whole walk and applied
once, so the model settles before anything redraws. `WalkTo`, which existed only
to return the write list, is gone.

### UB-142 — renaming a style companion would have moved its component's folder `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Caught in review of UB-135 rather than in use, and it only became destructive
BECAUSE of UB-135: a folder-owning rename now really moves the folder.

A card's title has `.style`/`.hooks` stripped, so `Showcase.style.uitkx` sitting
in `Showcase/` reports its name as "Showcase" - exactly like the component that
owns the folder. The folder-ownership test compared that title to the folder
name and nothing else, so renaming the STYLE companion satisfied it. Before
UB-135 that merely placed the renamed companion in a new folder; after it, the
rename would have taken the entire component folder, every sub-component
included, along with a companion.

FIX: only a plain `.uitkx` module can own a folder. A companion never does.

### UB-143 — an unsaved module could never be an import target `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-21: a component and a style module, both created in the
builder and neither saved, with `import * as SomeComponentStyle from
"./someComponentStyle.style"`. No preview, and the console carried
`hmr_SomeCompnent_1.cs(98,105): error CS0103: The name 'SomeComponentStyle'
does not exist in the current context`.

ROOT CAUSE, confirmed by running the resolver directly rather than by reading
it: `ImportResolver.MapSpecifierToPath` builds its answer by joining strings
with FORWARD slashes, so it returns a path whose separators are all `/` where
every session in the workspace is keyed by a `Path.GetFullPath` path, which on
Windows uses backslashes. The HMR compiler passes that raw forward-slash path
straight into
`UitkxSourceExists`, which consults the builder's `SourceOverlay` - and the
overlay's dictionary lookup missed, every time, for every import target.
`UitkxSourceExists` then fell through to `File.Exists`, which is false for a
module that has never been saved. The import was dropped in silence, no alias
was emitted, and the component failed to compile on the alias name.

Only UNSAVED targets were affected: for a saved module the `File.Exists`
fallback answers true, forward slashes and all, which is why this never showed
up before the builder could hold a whole tree in memory.

FIX: the overlay canonicalises its argument before looking up. That is the right
layer - the overlay is the builder's adapter between "any path the compiler
happens to hold" and "my canonically-keyed sessions", and owning that mismatch
is its job. `File.Exists`, the retry reader and namespace derivation all already
tolerate forward slashes, and have been receiving them for every saved import
target all along, so nothing else needed changing.

### UB-144 — a new import drew an anchor dot and no line `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Same report: the import row appeared on the card with its anchor dot, and no
edge was ever drawn to the style card.

ROOT CAUSE: `BuilderCanvasHost.RefreshGraph` - the commit path every canvas edit
funnels through - re-parsed the changed file into its graph node and then called
`RenderCanvas`. It rebuilt the card's CONTENT and never touched `graph.Edges`.
The drawing code paints an anchor dot per import ROW, independent of any edge,
so a freshly added import got its dot immediately while the edge list still knew
nothing about it. The edge only appeared if something happened to remount the
whole canvas. Its own doc comment claimed it "rebuilds ONE card and redraws the
edges", and the gap between redrawing edges and rebuilding them is the bug.

This is why the earlier UB-121 fix did not hold: `AppendMissingImportEdges` ran
at mount, so it too only helped after a remount.

FIX: imports are STRUCTURE, not card decoration, so re-parsing a module rebuilds
what it points at. `BuilderGraphService.RefreshEdgesFor(graph, nodeIndex)`
rebuilds that one node's import edges against the nodes already on the canvas,
through the same single resolver a full load uses - no language-server round
trip, so it can run on every commit.

Also added, because the failure was invisible: an import that resolves to
nothing now logs one warning naming the file, the specifier and the path it
looked for. A dot with no line said nothing about why, and that silence is what
made this take a screenshot to find.

### UB-145 — a name was refused because another KIND used it `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-21: creating a style module called `someComponent` was
refused with "someComponent already exists" because a COMPONENT called
`SomeComponent` was on the canvas. They produce `someComponent.style.uitkx` and
`SomeComponent.uitkx` - two different files, and exactly the pairing the folder
convention is built around.

ROOT CAUSE: `ValidateNewName` compared the candidate against every card's
DISPLAY TITLE, case-insensitively. A title has its `.style`/`.hooks` stripped,
so a style module and its component report the same title by design, and the
casing convention (PascalCase components, camelCase modules) was erased by the
case-insensitive compare. The create flow's own commit step already had the
right test - does the FILE this would produce already exist - so the live
validation was both wrong and a duplicate of a correct check further down.

FIX: a name collides only when the file it would produce collides. Both prompts
now pass the mapping from name to path, so the validation and the commit ask the
same question. `RenameTargetPath` is that mapping for a rename, shared with
`RenameModule` so the prompt and the rename can never disagree about what a name
would produce.

### UB-146 — dropping a style module on an element did not style it `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-21: a style module with `Height = Px(200)` and a dark
background, imported into a component, and the preview showed nothing but an
empty stage. The markup was `<VisualElement>` with no attributes: the import had
been added and nothing used it.

ROOT CAUSE: the drop handler ignored `rowIdx` for style modules entirely. Every
style-module drop added the IMPORT and stopped, whether it landed on a card or
on a specific element - and an import styles nothing. The card gained a line,
the preview looked identical, and the actual styling had to be typed by hand.

FIX: a style module dropped ON AN ELEMENT is applied to it - the style attribute
is set and the import added if the file lacks it, as one undoable action. A
module with several exports asks which. Dropped on the card rather than a row it
still adds the import alone, which remains the right answer there.

The write order is load-bearing: the attribute is written first, against the
row's current source line, because inserting the import at the top shifts every
line below it by one.

### UB-147 — the style alias collided with the component it was imported into `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-21, immediately after UB-145 made the name pair legal:
`CS0117: 'SomeComponent' does not contain a definition for 'container'`.

ROOT CAUSE, and it is UB-145's direct consequence: a star import's alias was the
module name PascalCased. A style module called `someComponent` therefore bound
the alias `SomeComponent` - the importing component's OWN name - so
`SomeComponent.container` resolved to the component type, which has no such
member. Allowing the pair was right; deriving the alias by capitalising it was
not, because the two conventions (PascalCase components, camelCase modules)
collapse onto the same identifier by construction.

FIX: `ImportAliasFor` chooses a name that cannot collide with something the file
already means - the importing component's own name and every binding its
existing imports introduce - falling back to `NameStyle`, then a counter. A
module that is ALREADY imported keeps whatever alias it was given, so styling a
second element from the same module references the name the file actually binds
rather than inventing a fresh one.

### UB-148 — every keystroke recompiled every unsaved module `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-21: "it all feels much much slower".

ROOT CAUSE, and it is an interaction with the save-only contract rather than a
plain bug: `CompileDirty` compiled EVERY dirty session on every debounced edit.
Nothing is saved until the user says so, so the dirty set only grows as they
work - and on Unity 6.5 in-process Roslyn is unavailable (HMR-ROSLYN-65), so
each of those compiles spawns an external csc process. The editor therefore got
measurably slower with every module added to an unsaved tree, which is exactly
the state the builder is designed to keep you in.

FIX: a module is rebuilt only when its own text has moved since it last
compiled, or when something it imports was rebuilt this round. Walking in import
order is what makes the second test valid - every dependency is decided before
its dependents. A successful compile records the text it was built from; a
failure forgets it, so a broken module keeps retrying.

### UB-149 — a module the user had just created reported itself broken `UNVERIFIED` `LOW`

`UITKX2105: 'someComponent.style.uitkx' does not contain a valid top-level
declaration`, the moment a style module was created.

ROOT CAUSE: a style or util module is created EMPTY by design (UB-112 - only
what the user adds is exported), and an empty file genuinely has no valid
top-level declaration. The builder was manufacturing an invalid file every time
and then reporting it back to the user about a file they had not started
writing.

FIX: a blank buffer reports nothing. It is not broken, it is unstarted.

### UB-150 — the using alias for an unsaved import target was never emitted `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-21, after UB-147 fixed the alias NAME:
`CS0103: The name 'SomeComponentStyle' does not exist in the current context`,
with the import and the style usage both correct on screen.

ROOT CAUSE, and it is NOT in the builder: `ImportScopeFacts` - the language-lib
code that works out which `using` lines a file's imports imply - resolves every
import TARGET itself, and read those targets straight off the filesystem:
`File.Exists(target)` then `File.ReadAllText(target)`, at four separate sites. A
module that has never been written fails the existence test, so the import is
skipped, no alias is emitted for it, and every reference to that alias fails to
compile.

This is the same hole as UB-143 one layer further in. UB-143 fixed the overlay
lookup inside `UitkxHmrCompiler`; this is a SECOND, independent disk read, in
the shared language library, which no overlay reached.

FIX at the layer the fault lives: all four sites now go through one
`ReadTargetDirectives` accessor with an injectable `SourceOverlay`. A null
overlay - which is what the source generator and the language server pass -
falls through to disk and behaves exactly as before, so their behaviour is
unchanged by construction. `UitkxHmrCompiler` publishes its own unsaved-buffer
overlay into that hook before every compile, so ordering between setting the
overlay and initialising the reflection handles cannot matter.

SG suite 1879/1879, LSP suite 180/180.

DEPLOY NOTE: the fix ships in `Analyzers/Ruitk.Language.dll`, which HMR loads
with `Assembly.LoadFrom`. That locks the file for the life of the Unity process,
so this one DLL cannot be replaced while the editor is running - unlike every
other payload file. Unity has to be closed for it to land.

### UB-151 — the inline editor's text sat at the top of its box `UNVERIFIED` `LOW`

The single-line inline editor takes the HEIGHT of the canvas row it covers, and
the compact chrome pins the text 2px from the top - so whenever the row was
taller than one line of text, the glyphs sat at the top with all the slack
underneath. `CenterSingleLine` splits the surplus evenly instead.

### UB-152 — the CS0103 the owner kept seeing came from the LANGUAGE SERVER `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-21, after UB-150 shipped and Unity was closed, reopened and
all assets reimported: still `CS0103: The name 'SomeComponentStyle' does not
exist in the current context`.

WHAT WAS ACTUALLY TRUE at that moment, established from the artefacts rather
than from reading code: HMR's temp directory held BOTH
`hmr_SomeComponent_11.dll` and
`hmr_Ruitk.Uitkx.__RuitkBuilderUnsaved___.SomeComponent.someComponent_style.__Exports_8.dll`,
timestamped three minutes earlier, and a string scan of the component assembly
showed it referencing `someComponent_style`, `__Exports` and `container`. A DLL
is only written on success. The Editor log carried no `preview compile` failure
and no `Render failed`. **The compile was already fixed by UB-150.**

ROOT CAUSE of the message that remained: it was never the compiler's. The
builder's source pane shows `OnLspDiagnosticsPublished`, and the language server
is a SEPARATE PROCESS that runs Roslyn over a virtual document. It holds the
focus file's buffer because the builder pushes it, but `ImportScopeFacts` -
which it also uses - resolved the IMPORT TARGET off the filesystem, where an
unsaved module does not exist. So the server reported a genuine-looking CS0103
about code that compiles perfectly well.

This is the fourth of the parallel layers CLAUDE.md names, and the one UB-150
did not reach: SG and HMR were fixed by the overlay, the IDE virtual doc was
not, because nothing set the overlay in the server process.

FIX: the server sets `ImportScopeFacts.SourceOverlay` to its own `DocumentStore`
at startup, so a module that is OPEN IN THE EDITOR is visible as an import
target. Editor content wins; anything not open falls through to disk exactly as
before, so a normal IDE session is unaffected.

LESSON, and the reason this entry is long: I twice declared CS0103 fixed after
fixing ONE resolver, without checking whether anything else resolved import
targets. There were four, in three processes. The check that finally settled it
was reading the compiler's own output artefacts instead of reasoning about the
code - the DLLs on disk said the compile had been working for some time while I
was still looking for a compile bug.

### UB-153 — the preview only ever compiled in response to an EDIT `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

This is the "no render", and it is why restarting Unity never helped: restarting
is the one thing guaranteed to reproduce it.

`MountPreview` calls `ShowFile(_focusFile, buffer, assemblyHint: null)` and
triggers no compile. `ResolveComponentType` then looks for a type carrying a
matching `[UitkxSource]` among the assemblies ALREADY LOADED. A compile only
ever ran from `NotifyBufferChanged`, which fires on an edit.

A builder tree that has not been edited in the CURRENT process therefore has no
compiled type to resolve, and the stage renders empty - no error, because
nothing failed. And that is every unsaved tree after a domain reload or an
editor restart: the buffers survive with the window's serialized state while the
compiled assemblies do not. The owner restarted Unity and reimported repeatedly,
each time landing back in exactly the state that cannot render.

Confirmed from artefacts before changing anything: `%TEMP%/UitkxHmr` did not
exist at all in the fresh session, and the Editor log contained no builder
output whatsoever - no compile had been attempted since Unity started, despite a
tree being open with two dirty buffers.

FIX: mounting the preview asks for the compile. It is the same debounced request
an edit makes, and UB-148 means it skips every module whose text has not moved,
so remounting is cheap.

WHY IT HID FOR SO LONG: during active editing the very next keystroke produced a
compile, so the preview worked. It only failed on a freshly opened session -
which is the state a frustrated user reaches for first.

### UB-154 — the preview render was never pumped `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

The stage stayed empty while the compile succeeded, the type resolved and
nothing threw. The reconciler time-slices its work onto a scheduler driven by
EditorApplication.update, and `Mount` enqueued the render and returned.
`UnmountPreview` already pumped that scheduler on the way OUT; nothing pumped it
on the way IN, so a mount became visible only if something else happened to tick
it - and when nothing did, the failure was completely silent, because no work
had run to throw. `Mount` now drains the render, and a mount that produces no
elements says so in the console naming the type and its assembly.

### UB-155 — the fiber tree outlived the types it was built for `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Once the render was pumped, a second failure surfaced underneath it, and the
owner's repro is the clearest possible statement of it: they aborted, started a
fresh tree, added a new component and a new style module, changed NOTHING - and
the preview showed the PREVIOUS component's render, label and all. Editing a
style module's colour or height also changed nothing on screen.

ROOT CAUSE: `Mount` created its `VNodeHostRenderer` once and reused it forever.
A recompile hands back a new Type from a new swap assembly, and opening another
file hands back a different component entirely, but the live fiber tree kept
holding the ORIGINAL types - so re-rendering into it re-rendered the old build.
On top of that, `UnmountPreview` tore down the FIBERS and left the elements they
had produced in the host, so whatever was on screen stayed on screen underneath
the next render.

FIX: the renderer is torn down whenever the component TYPE object changes -
which is every hot swap and every file switch - and the host is cleared with it,
in both the teardown path and the type-change path. Knob values still survive,
because they are carried across separately by `CarryOver`.

### UB-156 — open documents were invisible to path lookups in the LSP `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

The third appearance of one bug. `DocumentStore.TryGetByPath` compared
`Uri.LocalPath` - backslashes on Windows - against the caller's path with an
ordinal comparison. Anything that resolved a path by JOINING STRINGS, which is
what `ImportResolver.MapSpecifierToPath` does, therefore never matched a single
open document, so the overlay added in UB-152 could never fire and the server
kept publishing CS0103 for an unsaved import target.

Both sides are canonicalised now. Same root as UB-143 (the HMR overlay) and the
same shape as UB-119 (the unsaved-root prefix test): a path built by
concatenation is compared against one produced by the platform, and on Windows
those never agree.

### UB-157 — the preview vanished on the first click `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-22: a new component with a label renders, and disappears
the moment anything in it is clicked.

ROOT CAUSE, and it is UB-155's fix meeting an older weakness: every hot swap
LOADS ANOTHER assembly, and they all carry the same `[UitkxSource]` path, so
`ResolveComponentType` with no assembly hint can return a type from ANY of them
- in practice the oldest still loaded. A remount with no hint, which is what a
selection or a canvas rebuild produces, therefore resolved a DIFFERENT Type
object than the live tree had been built for. UB-155 now treats a changed type
as a hot swap and tears the tree down, clearing the stage - so the preview went
blank. It could not recover either, because UB-148 correctly skips recompiling a
module whose text has not moved, so no new assembly arrived to rebuild from.

The three changes are each right on their own; together they exposed that the
pane never knew which assembly it was currently showing.

FIX: the pane remembers the assembly its live build came from and resolves
against it whenever no newer hint is supplied. Switching to a different file
forgets it, because a different component has nothing to do with that build.

### UB-158 — every debounced edit built modules the preview cannot show `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner 2026-08-22: "this entire process is freaking slow. doing anything is
freaking slow."

ROOT CAUSE: `CompileDirty` built every DIRTY module in the workspace, and under
the save-only contract every module is dirty for the whole session - so the cost
of one keystroke grew with the size of the tree, and on Unity 6.5 each of those
builds is an external csc process (in-process Roslyn is unavailable,
HMR-ROSLYN-65). UB-148 already stopped rebuilding modules whose TEXT had not
moved; this is the other half.

FIX: only the focused module and what it imports, transitively, are built. A
module the preview cannot reach cannot change what is on screen.

LIKELY ALSO FIXES the owner's second report in the same message - a style module
linked to a component had no visual effect until an unrelated edit to the
component. A style module is created EMPTY, and as a dirty module it was
compiled immediately, loading an assembly that defines its `__Exports` with no
entries. Types are resolved by NAME across the swap assemblies, so the component
could keep binding to that first, empty one. With this change an unimported
module is never built, so the empty version never gets loaded, and the style is
first compiled as a DEPENDENCY of the component that imports it. NOT VERIFIED -
recorded as the mechanism that fits, not as a confirmed fix.

OPEN, owner ask in the same message: the preview should refresh deterministically
after every action rather than on a 300 ms debounce. The debounce exists because
a compile is expensive; that is the thing to make cheap first, and
HMR-ROSLYN-65 (external csc per compile) is the real ceiling.

### UB-159 — nothing owned "which assembly is the current build" `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

This is the root cause behind a run of symptoms I chased separately and patched
one at a time. Recording it as one entry, because it is one bug.

Every hot swap LOADS ANOTHER assembly, and each carries the same
`[UitkxSource]` path for the module it was built from. `ResolveComponentType`
resolved a component by SCANNING loaded assemblies for that stamp - so once a
session had produced more than one swap, the scan returned an arbitrary one, in
practice the oldest still loaded. Nothing in the system held the answer to
"which assembly is the current build of this module"; the pane guessed, every
time, from data that could not distinguish them.

Symptoms this produced, all of which I previously attributed to other causes:

- Leaving a component and coming back rendered an EARLIER build (owner,
  2026-08-22). `MountPreview` passed no assembly hint, so the scan chose.
- It STUCK that way, because UB-148 correctly skips rebuilding a module whose
  text has not moved - so no fresh assembly arrived to displace the stale one.
  Before UB-148 the constant rebuilding hid this.
- A style module linked to a component had no visual effect until an unrelated
  edit: the component's own build was current, but the pane was rendering an
  older component assembly compiled before the style had any entries.
- The preview vanishing on a click (UB-157), which I fixed by having the PANE
  remember an assembly - a patch at the wrong layer, treating the symptom.

FIX at the layer that has the answer: `BuilderPreviewCompiler` produced these
assemblies, so it records which one each module was last built into and exposes
`BuiltAssemblyFor(path)`. The window hands the pane an explicit assembly on
every path - after a compile, after a SKIPPED compile, and on mount - so the
pane never scans and never guesses. A failed build forgets the entry, so a
broken module does not keep serving its last good one.

LESSON: I fixed four symptoms of this across four rounds without asking who was
supposed to own the fact. The question that would have found it in one step is
"which component knows this, and is it being asked?" - not "what could make this
particular render wrong".

### UB-160 — typing ran a full analyzer pass and rebuilt the element set per keystroke `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner 2026-08-22: typing a component or attribute name produces spikes.

Two costs sat directly on the keystroke path, both measured against what the
user can actually perceive rather than guessed at:

1. `CodeField.Recolor` ran `BuilderLanguage.Diagnose` - the whole diagnostics
   analyzer - on every character. Colouring genuinely has to be synchronous,
   because the user is looking at it; nothing about DIAGNOSTICS has to be true
   this keystroke. They now run 250 ms after typing settles, sharing nothing
   with the colouring pass but one extra parse per settle instead of one full
   analyze per character.

2. `KnownElementsOrNull` rebuilt its set - schema element names plus every
   runtime-registered element plus the graph's exports - on EVERY call, and it
   is passed to `SetContent` on every programmatic edit. Worse than the
   allocation: `SetKnownElements` skips its re-colour when handed the SAME
   INSTANCE, so a fresh set each time forced a SECOND full re-colour of the
   source pane per edit. It is now built once per graph and invalidated where
   the graph changes.

NOT ADDRESSED, and the next thing to look at if spikes remain: `RecolorRows`
rebuilds the rich text of every visible line on each keystroke. That is real
work and it is on the synchronous path by necessity, but it could be limited to
the lines that actually changed. Left alone deliberately - it is a correctness-
sensitive path and the two cheap wins above should be measured first.

### UB-161 — the preview compiled on keystrokes instead of on actions `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner ask 2026-08-22: compile when an ACTION happens, on the same rule the
history uses - not while typing, where a name typed and abandoned costs a build
of half-written code that can only fail.

RESEARCH FIRST, because the rule is only as good as the trigger list. Every way
a rendered result can change was enumerated from the mutation sites, not from
memory: `ApplyEdit` (8 call sites), direct `BufferText` assignment, `Undo`/`Redo`,
`AdoptDiskText`, `MarkClean`, session creation and removal, and the path changes
a rename produces. That collapses to four triggers:

1. an action commits - every canvas gesture, an applied or cancelled source
   edit, undo, redo, a history jump, a rename, a format-on-save
2. the preview mounts - opening, switching file, canvas remount, abort
3. the source pane's edit finishes - focus leaves the field
4. a buffer is adopted from disk - an external change

TWO GAPS THE RESEARCH FOUND, both pre-existing:

- Trigger 4 did not exist. An external file change refreshed the CARD and never
  rebuilt, so the preview silently kept showing the pre-change build. Rare
  enough that nobody hit it; wrong all the same.
- `RefreshEditedBuffer` has no callers at all, not even a delegate reference.
  Dead code that looked like a fifth trigger.

AND THE FINDING THAT DECIDED THE DESIGN: `Record` with no open scope commits
IMMEDIATELY, so the source pane was already creating one history entry PER
CHARACTER - a hundred rows for typing a name, and a Ctrl+Z that walked back one
letter at a time. Compiling "on history commit" would therefore have changed
nothing. Typing now goes through `RecordTyping`, which merges consecutive
keystrokes in the same file into one entry, at the tip of the history only and
never inside a gesture scope.

The CARD still re-parses per keystroke - that is a cheap local parse and it is
what makes the canvas feel live. Only the COMPILE waits for a boundary.

NOT FIXED, and it is the other half of what the owner feels: a single compile
still spawns an external csc process on Unity 6.5 (HMR-ROSLYN-65), so the pause
AFTER committing an edit is unchanged. Fewer compiles, not faster ones.

### UB-162 — undoing the only module left a card that could not be deleted `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-22: create a component in a fresh builder, Ctrl+Z, and the
card stays - emptied rather than removed - and right-click delete does nothing to
it. The title bar reads "1 file(s), 0 dirty", which is the tell: there was no
session at all, so nothing was dirty and nothing could be deleted.

TWO causes, both needed for the symptom:

1. `RebindFocusIfMissing` walked the sessions looking for a new focus and, when
   there were NONE left, simply returned - leaving `_focusFile` naming the module
   that had just been discarded. `MountCanvas` mounts whatever `_focusFile`
   names, so it mounted a module with no session behind it. An empty workspace
   now clears the focus, which is what makes `MountCanvas` show the empty state.

2. `LoadTreeAsync` added the focus file to its inventory UNCONDITIONALLY, after
   the hidden-file filter had been applied to everything else. So a focused
   module that was deleted - or whose path a move had vacated - still got a node,
   and deleting it again changed nothing, because the card was never coming from
   a session in the first place. The focus is now filtered like every other file,
   and if it is hidden it is left out of the member set too.

Also removed here: `RefreshEditedBuffer`, which had no callers at all, not even
a delegate reference. It was found while enumerating the compile triggers for
UB-161, where it looked like a fifth trigger.

### UB-163 — an empty workspace threw on every focus lookup `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Introduced by UB-162 and reported immediately: after Ctrl+Z removed the only
module the card finally went away, and the console filled with
`ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null. Parameter name: key` from
`ApplyLedgerWrites`, `RecompileWhenQuiet` and `RequestServerTokensWhenQuiet`.

ROOT CAUSE: UB-162 made `_focusFile` null when nothing is left to focus, which
is correct - and exposed that NOTHING tolerated it. `Dictionary.TryGetValue`
throws on a null key, so `BuilderWorkspace.TryGet(null)` threw rather than
answering "nothing"; and nine separate `Path.GetFullPath(_focusFile)`
comparisons threw for the same reason. Only one of the ten had guarded itself.

FIX at both layers rather than at the ten call sites:

- `TryGet` treats a null path as NOT FOUND. A lookup asked about nothing should
  answer "nothing"; every caller already handles a null result.
- A single `FocusFull` accessor returns the focused full path or empty, and all
  ten comparisons go through it. An empty string simply never equals a real
  path, so "there is no focus" reads as "this is not the focused file" - which
  is what each of those comparisons actually wants.

This also explains the second half of the report - right-click delete doing
nothing. The delete DID mark the file, then threw on its way to remounting the
canvas, so the card never went away. One exception, two symptoms.

### UB-164 — "read-only" was blamed for a refusal that had nothing to do with permissions `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-22: delete refuses with "Can't delete NewerComp.uitkx
(read-only)" on a module the builder itself created under Assets, which is
writable by definition.

ROOT CAUSE: `MarkForDeletion` returns false for TWO unrelated reasons - the
location is read-only, or the module is ALREADY marked - and the window reported
both as read-only. A module that had been marked by an earlier attempt therefore
reported a permissions problem that did not exist, and repeating the delete
could never have helped: it was already deleted as far as the model was
concerned, and the CARD was the thing that was stale.

That staleness came from UB-163: the first delete marked the file and then threw
on its way to remounting the canvas, so the card survived. Every attempt after
that hit the already-marked branch and blamed permissions.

FIX: the handler names each case. An already-marked module re-syncs the canvas
instead of complaining, which self-heals exactly the state UB-163 produced, and
a genuine read-only refusal names the DIRECTORY so the claim can be checked
rather than taken on faith.

### UB-165 — deleting the last visible module crashed the tree build `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-22: "delete still doesnt work at all, its broken
completely."

ROOT CAUSE, and it is UB-162's fix reaching a state that was never reachable
before: `SeedDefaultPositions` opens with `depth[rootIndex] = 0` over an array
sized by the node count. UB-162 correctly stopped a hidden focus from being
forced into the member set, which made an EMPTY member set possible for the
first time - delete the last visible module and there is genuinely nothing left
to lay out. Indexing a zero-length array threw, inside `LoadTreeAsync`.

WHY IT LOOKED LIKE DELETE DID NOTHING: `BuilderCanvasHost.Mount` wrapped the LSP
call and the graph build in ONE catch that reported everything as "LSP
unavailable". So an IndexOutOfRangeException in the layout surfaced as a
language-server problem, the canvas never updated, and the delete - which had
already marked the file correctly - appeared to be ignored.

FIXED, three things:

- An empty tree lays out as empty. A root index outside the node list falls back
  to 0 rather than throwing.
- The two failures are separated. An LSP failure still says so; a build failure
  says "Could not build the tree" AND logs its stack, so the next one names
  itself instead of pointing at the wrong subsystem.
- The import context menu uses `ShowSimple`, like the card menu, so it opens at
  the row that was right-clicked instead of away from it. One action does not
  need a search field either.

### UB-168 — the card menu deleted an INDEX, not a module `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-23: delete silently does nothing, with no toast, no error
and nothing in the Unity log - verified, the log is clean.

ROOT CAUSE: `ShowCardMenu` built its items as `OnPick = () => RequestDeleteCard(index)`,
capturing the node's INDEX at the moment the menu opened. A pick runs later, and
by then the graph may have been rebuilt - a compile finishing, a canvas refresh -
so the index no longer addresses the module it was aimed at. `RequestDeleteCard`
then hit its bounds guard and returned false INTO SILENCE: no toast, no log,
nothing. That is why it read as "completely broken" rather than as a failure.

This is the same index-as-identity fragility the project-model refactor was
about, surviving in a menu closure.

FIX: the menu captures the module's PATH and calls `OnDeleteFile` directly, so a
pick cannot address the wrong module or a missing one. The keyboard path still
resolves by index - it acts immediately, on the live selection - but now says
"Nothing selected to delete" instead of returning false quietly.

### UB-169 — the import menu opened wherever the last menu had `UNVERIFIED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-23: right-clicking an import row on the COMPONENT opened
the menu over the STYLE card.

ROOT CAUSE: every menu opens at the click only because the GESTURE records where
that was, via `RememberMenuPointer`. Two gestures do it - the canvas right-click
and the library. The import row added in UB-166 did not, so `Place` fell back to
the STALE remembered point, which was wherever the previous menu had been opened
from. Not a placement bug so much as a missing handshake.

FIX: the import right-click records its pointer like every other menu gesture.

### UB-170 — deleting one card deleted a different one `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-23, and the repro names the bug exactly: create a
component, create a style module, link NOTHING. Delete the style - nothing
happens, just a blink. Delete the COMPONENT - and the STYLE disappears.

TWO causes, compounding:

1. NODE ORDER WAS NONDETERMINISTIC. The member set is a `HashSet<string>`, and
   the nodes were built by iterating it. HashSet order is unspecified and shifts
   as the set changes, so adding or deleting a module could RENUMBER every card.
   Anything holding a card index from a previous render then addressed a
   different module than the one it was built for.

2. THE CARD MENU CARRIED AN INDEX. `onCardContext(index)` is a lambda living on
   a KEYED element - keyed by file path, so the element survives re-renders by
   design. When the numbering shifted underneath it, the element kept a lambda
   closed over the OLD index. Right-clicking one card opened the menu for
   another, and the delete followed the menu.

That is the full explanation of the repro: the two cards had swapped numbering,
so each delete acted on the other card - and deleting the style "did nothing"
because it marked the component, which was then hidden and re-added by the
pending-new pass on the same load.

FIX, both halves:

- Nodes are built from a SORTED list, so numbering changes only when membership
  genuinely does.
- The card menu carries the module PATH and the host resolves it when the menu
  opens. UB-168 fixed this one layer up - the menu ITEM - while the number
  reaching the menu was already wrong. This is the same lesson one layer deeper:
  an index is a position, not an identity, and a position is not safe to carry
  across a render.

STILL INDEX-BASED, and left alone deliberately: `onSelect` and `setSelected`
carry indices through the same keyed lambdas. With ordering now deterministic
the window for staleness is much smaller, and the consequence is cosmetic - the
wrong card highlights - rather than destructive. Worth converting, not worth
churning the whole view for in the same pass as a data-loss bug.

### UB-171 — the focused module could never be deleted `UNVERIFIED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-23: the toast reads "Deleted someNew.style.uitkx - applies
on Save" - the RIGHT module, correctly marked - and the card stays on the canvas.

ROOT CAUSE: `ConnectedComponent` seeds its result with the start node
(`seen.Add(start)`), so the FOCUS is always in the member set. UB-162 added
`if (focusVisible) member.Add(focus)` to keep a hidden focus out - and that guard
was a NO-OP, because the walk had already put it in one line earlier. A deleted
module that happened to be the focused one therefore kept its card forever, and
since the builder focuses a module the moment you create it, that is the normal
case rather than an edge one.

FIX at the layer that matters: ONE gate, where the cards are built. Guarding each
ROUTE into the member set is what failed - there were three, and the walk's own
seeding was invisible from the call site. Every contributor now passes the same
hidden check before a node exists.

Also fixed here: a module marked for deletion is no longer a valid FOCUS. Its
session lives until Save, so the missing-session test alone left the window
pointed at a module the user had just deleted, with the preview still describing
it and the source pane still showing it.

LESSON, and it is the third time in this campaign: I guarded the CALLERS instead
of the place the decision is finally made. UB-162 guarded two routes into the
member set and missed the one inside a helper; the fix is a single gate at the
point of use, which cannot be bypassed by a route nobody remembered.

### UB-172 — a deleted module kept its NAME reserved `UNVERIFIED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-23: delete a style module (which now works), then create it
again with the same name - "already exists".

ROOT CAUSE: a deletion is PENDING until Save, so the session goes on occupying
its path. `CreateNew` refused on `_sessions.ContainsKey`, and `ValidateNewName`
refused on `TryGet != null`, both of which are true for a module that is deleted
as far as the user is concerned. The name was reserved by something invisible.

FIX: one rule - `IsPathAvailable` - used by the prompt, by the creation guard and
by `CreateNew` itself, so they cannot disagree. A path whose deletion is pending
counts as AVAILABLE, and creating there REVIVES that session: the deletion is
taken back and the buffer replaced, rather than a second session being added for
the same path.

Reviving rather than adding also avoids a save-ordering hazard that would
otherwise have been introduced here: `SaveAll` writes before it deletes, so a
fresh session at a path already queued for deletion would have been written and
then immediately trashed.

KNOWN ASYMMETRY, recorded rather than papered over: undoing the re-creation
discards the revived session but does not restore the deletion MARK, so undo
lands on "absent" rather than on "deleted, pending". For a never-saved module -
the reported case - those are the same state. For a SAVED module they differ, and
the module would come back at Save. Deleting a saved module and re-creating it
under the same name inside one session is the only way to reach that, and the
right fix is for the ledger to model a revive as its own change kind.

### UB-173 — the tree model `SHIPPED` `STRUCTURAL`

Not a defect report: the shape that produced UB-135 through UB-172. Intent was
stored BESIDE the data - a pending-delete list, a pending-folder-move list - and
every consumer had to join the two. Five defects in two days were one consumer
that did not know to join, or one route that bypassed the join.

Plans~/BUILDER_TREE_MODEL.md is the plan and it is fully implemented. Load reads
the tree once; every manipulation happens on it; rendering reads it; Save walks
it and writes. Deletion is ABSENCE - a module leaves the tree and that is the
whole of it - and Save works out what that implies by diffing against the paths
that were on disk last time. There is nothing left to join.

This RETIRES the known asymmetry recorded under UB-172. There is no "deleted,
pending" state for an undo to land on any more: the ledger holds the module the
deletion removed, and undo puts that same module back with its identity, its
buffer and its DiskPath intact. Deleting a saved module and re-creating it under
the same name inside one session is now the same operation as any other move
through the tree.

### UB-174 — the library pane was one long scroll `SHIPPED` `LOW`

Owner ask 2026-08-22, deferred behind the delete fix: "on the left side menu,
lets have 5 items alwyas shown, the rest should be collapse".

Each section now shows five rows and folds the rest behind "+N more"; opening one
is remembered across rebuilds, so a new graph cannot close a drawer the user just
opened. A SEARCH reaches the whole library, folded rows included - a filter that
could not see past the fold would be a search that lies about what is there.

### UB-176 — opening a file drew ONE card, not the tree `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-23, right after the tree model landed: right-click
`ShowcaseFieldsPanel.uitkx` (a child, under `ShowcaseDemoPage/components/`) then
"Open in RUITK UI Builder", and the canvas shows a single card. Status bar:
"1 file(s), 0 dirty" - which is the model saying exactly what happened.

ROOT CAUSE: `OpenFor` still called `_workspace.Open(path)`, which adds ONE
module. `LoadTree` was written, tested and never entered - its only caller was
`AbortAll`. Under the old shape this was invisible: the canvas got its inventory
from the language server's workspace graph, so one open file still drew the whole
tree. Now the graph is a PROJECTION of the tree, and the tree had one thing in
it. The half of the model that reads was in; the half that loads was not wired to
the door the user comes through.

FIX: `LoadTreeFor` on the open path. A load REPLACES the tree, so unsaved work
vetoes it - the file is opened into the tree already present and the user is told
why they are looking at one card. Losing an unsaved buffer to a right-click in
the Project window is not a trade worth making.

### UB-177 — a folder NAMED "Components" was read as the nesting level `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

Found while fixing UB-176, before it could ever be seen: `ResolveTreeRoot` stepped
over any ancestor named "components", case-insensitively, on the way to the tree
root. This package ships its samples under `Samples/Components/`, holding 26
unrelated demo trees. Opening any sample would have climbed past
`ShowcaseDemoPage` to `Samples` and loaded all 26 into one canvas - which, the
moment UB-176 was fixed, would have read as a catastrophic regression.

ROOT CAUSE: matching a LAYOUT by name alone. "components" is a nesting level only
where it is the house layout - a folder named "components" INSIDE a component
that owns a module named after itself.

FIX: the guard, plus the resolution moved to `BuilderTree.ResolveRoot` where it
has no Unity dependency and `Builder~/ModelTests` can build the real folder
shapes on disk and assert against them. Six checks, including this exact layout.

### UB-178 — the styles "didn't save" `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-23: built a tree in a fresh builder, saved, and the
component files landed but the style modules did not. The console named it
exactly: `unresolved import in SomeNew.uitkx: "./someNew.style"` and, from the
compiler, `CS1029 no file at ./someNew.style(.uitkx)`.

The style files WERE written. They went to
`Assets/__RuitkBuilderUnsaved__~/SomeNew/someNew.style.uitkx` - the provisional
root, whose name ends in "~", which the Asset Database ignores wholesale. So the
bytes were on disk, Unity never imported them, and the component's import
compiled to nothing. Worse than not writing them at all, because nothing said so.

ROOT CAUSE, and it is the same disease one level up: `NeedsLocation` was a FLAG
each caller set. `CreateModule` passed `needsLocation: !rooted` - true for the
first module of a new tree, and FALSE for every module created afterwards,
because by then a focus file exists. So the component asked for a location and
the style module beside it never did: it was not in `UnlocatedModules()`, was
never re-homed, and `SaveAll` saw no flag and wrote it where it stood.

A SECOND defect kept it from self-correcting. `BuilderTree.MoveTo` carries the
subtree when a module owns its folder, but "inside" only meant BELOW: modules
sitting IN the folder - the style and hook companions, the whole reason the
folder exists - were left behind at a path their folder had just vacated. So
even re-homing the component would not have taken its styles along.

FIX, both at the point of decision. `BuilderWorkspace.IsUnlocated` DERIVES the
answer from where the module sits, so no caller can forget it and Save refuses
the provisional root whoever asks; the flag is deleted. And `MoveTo` carries
what is in the folder as well as under it. Six model checks pin the carry,
including that a COMPANION renaming does not take the folder with it.

### UB-179 — NullReferenceException from inside the canvas unmount `FIXED` `HIGH`

Same report, same console: `AppendToEffectList` threw during
`BuilderCanvasHost.Unmount` on the Save path. Not a builder bug - a reconciler
one, in `Shared/`, reachable by any host that tears a tree down.

ROOT CAUSE: `UnmountRoot` nulls the root but left `_nextUnitOfWork` pointing
into the tree it had just deleted. Unmount then drains the scheduler so effect
cleanups run before the host goes away - and that drain resumed a render slice
queued against the dead tree. `CompleteWork` appends to the root's effect list;
the root was null.

FIX: a teardown abandons its in-flight render (`UnmountRoot` and `AbandonRoot`
both), and `ProcessWorkUntilDeadline` returns immediately when the root is gone.
Both are needed: the scheduler holds the closure and cannot be made to forget
it, so the reconciler has to be able to say the slice is void. Two tests in
`SharedTests~` reproduce it - verified failing without the fix.

PROVEN 2026-08-28, after the owner challenged the diagnosis - a shipped game
has run on this reconciler for months without hitting it. A temporary editor
demo drove the scenario deterministically and settled three things:

1. **The mechanism is certain, not a race.** `AppendToEffectList` dereferences
   `_root` unconditionally on its first line. With in-flight work and a null
   root the NullReferenceException is guaranteed. Reproduced with the guard
   skipped; the stack frame is `FiberReconciler.AppendToEffectList`.

2. **It is unreachable on mount, and unreachable without state.** `CreateRoot`
   renders synchronously by design ("the initial mount is always synchronous;
   time-slicing is reserved for subsequent state-driven updates"), so nothing
   can ever be in flight during a mount. The trigger needs a STATE UPDATE whose
   render exceeds the frame budget, torn down before the next slice runs. That
   is far narrower than the original write-up implied, and it is the best
   explanation of why a shipped game never saw it.

3. **The fix cannot cost anything.** `_root` is assigned only in `CreateRoot`
   and nulled only in `UnmountRoot`, so `_root == null` means nothing is
   mounted and any in-flight work is orphaned by definition - the tree it
   points at was already deleted by `CommitDeletion`. A later render goes
   through `CreateRoot`, which sets the WIP root fresh. Cost is one null check
   per slice, and guard 2 also stops `Slice()` re-scheduling itself forever.

The demo was removed once it had answered the question (owner decision - the
fix stays, the harness does not). To recreate it: force `TimeSliceMs = 0`
AFTER `RuitkBootstrap.CreateHostContext` (it ends in `ApplyGlobalConfig()`,
which restores the project values), mount a stateful component through a
manual `IScheduler`, drive its setter, step one slice, unmount, then let the
queued slice run. Both of those ordering traps cost a round each.

STILL SHARP: `AppendToEffectList` has no null guard of its own. It is
unreachable today because the two guards above stand in front of it, but the
next path that reaches it will find the same edge (REMAINING_WORK: CORE-1).
### UB-180 — adding a component rearranged the canvas `FIXED` `MEDIUM`

Owner report 2026-08-23: "when you add new component, it rearranges the canvas,
need to stop."

ROOT CAUSE: card slots were only ever WRITTEN DOWN when the user dragged one.
Everything else was recomputed on each mount by `SeedDefaultPositions`, a
breadth-first walk whose answer depends on the node SET - so gaining one module
re-laid-out every card that had never been dragged.

FIX: `AdoptUnplaced` records the slots the default layout hands out, the first
time it hands them out. A slot is decided once and then remembered.

### UB-181 — the library did not follow the selection `SHIPPED` `LOW`

Owner ask 2026-08-23: "If a component is selected, it should be selected on the
menu too, including custom components/hooks/styles/and native components."

The library is the index of everything a tree can hold, so it is the natural
place to see WHAT the selected thing is. A card selection matches its library
entry by FILE, which survives a rename; a markup row matches by tag name unless
that tag names a module the tree holds, in which case the module wins. A folded
section opens when the selection lands inside it - a highlight nobody can see is
not a highlight. The ring colour is `BuilderPalette.Select`, defined once, so the
canvas and the library cannot disagree about what "selected" looks like.

### UB-175 — style entries do not chain `SHIPPED` `MEDIUM`

Specified by the owner 2026-08-23, which settled the two readings recorded
earlier: "when you write styles, it should go to the next property when you are
done editing - so when you are on last style, and done editing click enter, it
should select the + entry and the next enter should open the context like you
clicked it with the mouse."

Writing a style is a RUN of entries, and committing each by hand - click, type,
Enter, click - made the keyboard useless for the one thing on this card that is
nothing but typing. Enter now commits and opens the next entry. On the LAST one
there is nothing to advance to, so the "+ entry" row is ARMED and lights up in
the selection gold; Enter again opens its key menu exactly as clicking does.

Deliberately two presses. A menu that opened by itself after every entry would
be a trap, and the owner asked for the pause explicitly.

The seam is `BuilderInlineEditorOverlay.Show(advance:)`, which fires only when
the editor was closed by ENTER - a blur or a click elsewhere finishes the edit
just the same but is not a request to keep going. Anything that is not "add
another entry" disarms, so the highlight never outlives its meaning.

### UB-183 — no way to delete a style entry or its export `SHIPPED` `MEDIUM`

Owner report 2026-08-23: "in style editing there's no way to delete a style or
the object wrapping the group of styles."

Right-click did nothing on style rows - the handler returned on button 1 before
reaching anything. It now offers "Delete entry" on an entry line and "Delete
style <name>" on the export head, which needed the head to carry its block's
EXTENT: `ParseStyleDetail` now records where the export closes, so deleting it is
one range rather than a walk each caller repeats.

### UB-182 — drag a module from its card `SHIPPED` `LOW`

Owner ask 2026-08-23: dragging a component by its kind chip and dropping it on
another component. It is the same gesture as dragging that module out of the
library - the chip is just a second handle, next to the thing itself rather than
in a list of everything - so it arms the same payload and every drop rule
already in place applies unchanged, self-containment refusal included.

The payload vocabulary moved to `BuilderDragService.PayloadFor(kind, name)` and
the library now builds from it. Two places arm the same drag, and a payload the
drop handler does not recognise fails SILENTLY, as a drag that does nothing.

### UB-184 — a move left every importer pointing at the old path `FIXED` `HIGH`

Found while planning the folder view, before it could be reported: nothing
recomputed an import specifier when a module MOVED. Rename rewrote the module's
NAME wherever it appeared, which is not the same thing - it gets the last path
segment right and leaves a folder segment naming the same module wrong, so
`"../Panel/Panel"` from outside a renamed folder stayed broken. And a module that
moved without being renamed had nothing rewritten at all.

This is the primitive the naming convention and the folder view both stand on:
either one moves modules, and a move that does not carry its imports produces
exactly the CS1029 wave the owner already lost an evening to.

FIX: `CaptureImports` / `ReconcileImports`. Capture records what every import
POINTED AT before the operation; reconcile re-derives every specifier from where
the modules actually ended up. Both ends are handled - a module that moved
changes how everyone reaches it, and an IMPORTER that moved changes how it
reaches everyone else, which rewriting only the moved module's importers would
have missed.

Bindings are keyed by (importer, LINE), not by specifier text, because rename
edits that text before the move happens and a text-keyed snapshot could not find
its own entries afterwards. Rewrites use the parser's own specifier SPAN rather
than searching the buffer - a specifier is an ordinary string and can appear
anywhere else in the file - and are applied last-line-first so the spans ahead of
each stay valid.

`MapSpecifier` and its new inverse now live together in `BuilderSpecifiers`,
which is pure and linked into `Builder~/ModelTests`: 14 checks drive the round
trip over every shape the house layout produces, in both directions. They are
only correct as a PAIR, and a disagreement would not produce one bad import - it
would rewrite every import in the tree to something that does not resolve.

### UB-185 — a new style module became its own tree `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-23, with a screenshot: creating a style module re-stacked
the whole canvas. UB-180 had already frozen card slots, so this was a SECOND
cause, and the freeze made it worse - it persisted the wrong arrangement.

ROOT CAUSE: `ResolveRoot` derived the tree root by walking import edges upward
FROM THE FOCUS and taking a module nobody imports. That makes the root a
property of the focus, and a module nothing imports yet is EVERY module the
moment it is created. Creating a style module and focusing it made that style
its own root. The saved layout is keyed on the root path, so the key changed, no
stored position matched, every card got a fresh breadth-first slot - and
`AdoptUnplaced` then wrote that arrangement down under the new key.

The owner's UserSettings shows the history plainly: 35 layout files, most keyed
on a STYLE MODULE as "root" - one phantom tree per style module ever created,
going back weeks.

FIX: the root is the module that owns the tree's ROOT FOLDER, found with
`BuilderTree.ResolveRoot` - the same folder walk the loader uses, which gives the
same answer from any module in the tree. The import-walk version is deleted, and
with it the second, conflicting definition of "root". A model check asserts the
property that broke: every module in a fixture tree, imported or not, resolves to
the same root.

Also: the layout lookup now tries the deterministic root key FIRST and falls back
to the member scan, which returns whichever file lists the focus first in
directory order.

NOT migrated, and deliberately: the 35 stale configs are left alone. Layouts
saved under a style-module key are not found again, so a tree whose arrangement
lived in one of those comes back with default slots once. These are throwaway
test trees; re-keying them is speculative work on data nobody needs.

### UB-186 — the chip drag was wired to the wrong element `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-23: "dragging from the chip doesnt add the component to
another". Shipped in UB-182 and it did nothing.

ROOT CAUSE: two Labels render a kind chip - the L0 PILL and the L1/L2 card
header badge - and both are built from `KindLabel(node.Kind)`. The edit landed on
the first, which is the L0 pill. At Layer 2, where the owner works, the chip has
no handlers at all.

FIX: both chips arm the drag, through one `BuilderCanvasDrawing.BeginCardDrag`
rather than two copies of the handler body. It returns whether it armed, so a
chip that cannot drag (a module with no resolvable name) leaves the press to
bubble and the header underneath still moves the card - one press, two gestures,
and only one of them may have it.

### UB-187 — the naming convention, as a birth-time default `SHIPPED` `MEDIUM`

Agreed with the owner 2026-08-23. Placement used ONE rule - "next to whatever is
focused" - so where a module landed depended on what the user happened to be
looking at, not on what the module IS.

The convention: a component and the style and hook modules named after it are one
FAMILY and share a folder. `NewComponent`, `newComponent.style` and
`useNewComponent.hooks` all resolve to the family `newComponent` - a hook drops
its `use` prefix, a component lowers its first letter, and the compare is
case-insensitive. A companion is born in its family's folder wherever that
component lives, not wherever the focus is.

A companion matching nothing, and every UTIL module, is born at the tree ROOT.
That is the closest shared parent of the modules that will import it, which at
birth is none of them - so the two readings the owner offered ("top parent" and
"closest shared root") agree here, and neither needs a file to move on its own
later. Utils are outside the family rule by decision: a util is a plain `.uitkx`
with no suffix to key off, and a util named for its component would collide with
the component's own file on a case-insensitive filesystem.

A family name appearing in more than one subtree resolves to the NEAREST
component to the focus, ties broken by ordinal-smallest path so the answer does
not depend on load order.

A DEFAULT, not an invariant: nothing re-places a module afterwards, which is what
lets the folder view (next) move anything anywhere without the convention arguing
with it. The toast names the folder, because a file that appears silently
somewhere the user is not looking is the same as a file that did not appear.

`BuilderNaming` is pure and linked into `Builder~/ModelTests` - 11 checks
including the prefix trap (`useful` is not a hook for "ful") and nearest-wins.

### UB-188 — the folder view `SHIPPED` `MEDIUM`

Step 4 of the agreed plan, and the owner's original ask: "another view/layer that
will show folder structure, and you could drag things there and when saving it
will sync that structure over there. and ofc it will also sit in memory until
saving."

A "Folders" toolbar button swaps the centre pane between the canvas and the tree
as FOLDERS - two projections of the same modules, one showing what imports what
and the other showing where things live. The hierarchy is DERIVED from the
modules' folders, so there is no folder here that nothing lives in and no list to
keep in step with the tree.

Dragging a module onto a folder moves it. Nothing reaches disk: the move is a
tree change like every other edit, so Save projects it (through
`AssetDatabase.MoveAsset`, keeping GUIDs and metas), Abort forgets it, and Ctrl+Z
walks it back. "In memory until saving" needed no work at all - it is what the
tree model already does.

Two rules the drop needs and would be wrong without:

- A component that OWNS its folder takes the folder with it. Dropping
  `SomeNew` into `Other/` yields `Other/SomeNew/SomeNew.uitkx`, not
  `Other/SomeNew.uitkx` with its children stranded - the house layout is
  ComponentName/ComponentName.uitkx with its children inside.
- It cannot be dropped INTO its own subtree, which would make the folder its own
  ancestor and drag every child in after it.

Every specifier the move invalidates is re-derived before the drop returns
(UB-184), which is what makes free placement safe: this pane exists to move
modules around, and a move that did not carry its imports would break the tree on
the first drag.

The convention (UB-187) does not argue with any of it. It decides where a module
is BORN and nothing re-places one afterwards, which is exactly why both features
can exist.

### UB-189 — an UNSAVED tree re-keyed its layout on every new component `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-24, after UB-185 had already fixed the root for saved
trees: creating a component still rearranged the canvas.

ROOT CAUSE: `ResolveRoot` walks up asking "is there a component named after this
folder", and it asked the FILESYSTEM. A tree that has never been saved has no
files, so the walk stopped at the first folder and returned wherever the FOCUS
was. Creating a nested component moves the focus into it, which moved the root
with it, which re-keyed the whole saved layout - so every card took a fresh slot.

UB-185 fixed the same class of bug for saved trees and could not have caught
this: its model test builds real folders on disk, which is exactly the case that
worked.

FIX: the walk takes a predicate for its one question, and the graph projection
answers it from the MODULES. Disk is still the answer for the loader, which runs
before there is a tree to ask. Three model checks, including an assertion that
the disk answer WOULD have been wrong for the same fixture - the test pins the
bug, not just the fix.

### UB-190 — editing a style did not update the component using it `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-24: "when editing style when its connected to an element,
sometimes the component its connected to will not update until many changes."

ROOT CAUSE: clicking a style entry selects that card, which moves the FOCUS onto
the style module. The preview compiler restricts its work to the focus and what
the focus IMPORTS - a forward walk - so the component that imports the style was
dropped from the batch and never rebuilt. It updated again only when something
moved the focus back, which is the "until many changes".

FIX: a module with no visual of its own is never what the preview is showing - a
component that imports it is. When the focus is not a Component, the batch also
takes the modules that reach it, transitively.

### UB-191 — the style Enter chain lost a race `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-24: "the whole write a style press enter move to the +
entry - rarely works."

ROOT CAUSE: committing an entry SCHEDULES the canvas refresh rather than doing it
inline, so the row for the next line does not exist when the chain looks for it.
It waited one deferred tick, which won sometimes.

FIX: it retries for up to twelve ticks, the same shape the inline editor already
uses to catch its own focus.

### UB-192 — creating a component dropped the keyboard `FIXED` `LOW`

Owner report 2026-08-24: "when you create a component the canvas loses focus and
you have to refocus manually with mouse to be able to create another."

The create prompt takes the keyboard and closing it hands it back to nothing, so
the next shortcut went to Unity. The window takes it back, the same way every
exit from the inline editor already does.

### UB-193 — folders could not be moved or folded `SHIPPED` `MED`

Owner ask 2026-08-24: "whole folders need to be able to move not just files, and
i should be able to collapse folders."

Dragging a folder moves everything under it. When a component OWNS the folder
that is the same move by a shorter route - moving the component already carries
its subtree - so that path is taken and the house layout is preserved. Otherwise
every module underneath is re-filed individually, keeping its position relative
to the folder that moved, with the imports captured ONCE around the whole batch:
reconciling per move would re-spell specifiers against a half-moved tree, each
pass correct about a state nobody ever sees.

Clicking a folder folds it. A press that never TRAVELS is a click and one that
does is a drag, so the whole row stays available to both rather than splitting it
into hit areas. A folder refuses to be dropped into itself or its own descendant.

### UB-194 — an edit taken BACK stopped updating the preview `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-24, and the sharpest repro in the campaign: change a label
to "Left side a" - it updates - then change it back to "Left side", and the
preview stays on "Left side a".

ROOT CAUSE: the preview compiled what was DIRTY, meaning different from disk.
Typing a value back to what is on disk makes the module CLEAN, so it left the
batch, nothing recompiled, and the preview went on showing the edit that had
just been taken back.

Dirtiness answers "does this need saving". The preview needs "does this need
BUILDING", and the compiler already tracked the answer - `_compiledFrom` holds
the text each module was last built from. Candidates now come from THAT.

Recorded as worse than before because UB-190 made the batch correct about which
modules matter, which surfaced how wrong the candidate set had always been.

### UB-195 — a new card landed below-right of the cursor `FIXED` `LOW`

A card is positioned by its TOP-LEFT, so placing it at the click put the whole
card down and to the right of where the user pointed. It is centred on the cursor
now, lifted so the pointer is over its title bar.

The library's "+ new" has no cursor at all and passed a fixed world point, which
is wherever the user has panned away from. It now places the card in the middle
of the viewport - the middle of what they are looking at.

### UB-196 — the entry chain only covered HALF the gesture `FIXED` `MED`

Owner correction 2026-08-24: "first enter makes you select the style name, second
the style value, then the 3rd should do the +entry. it does work when you are
just editing an existing text style because that's one stage."

The chain was built for editing an EXISTING entry, which is one inline editor and
one Enter. ADDING an entry is two menus - key, then value - and nothing armed the
"+ entry" row afterwards, so the run stopped at the end of every new entry.

Arming now happens where the entry is INSERTED, which is the end of both routes.
The row's line is looked up when Enter fires rather than stored, because
inserting an entry moves that row down and a remembered line would put the next
one in the wrong place.

### UB-197 — the keyboard came back only sometimes after a create `FIXED` `LOW`

The window took the keyboard back inline, but creating a module remounts the
canvas and the remount does not finish that tick - so focus landed on an element
that was about to be replaced. It retries while the remount settles.

### UB-198 — a style edit rebuilt the style and nothing that USED it `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-24, with the component focused: adding `Color = ColorBlue`
to a style module did not render, while editing the component's own text
rendered fine.

ROOT CAUSE, and it is the third layer of the same onion. UB-194 made the batch
"everything whose text changed since it was last BUILT" - which is the style. The
component's own text did not change, so it was not a candidate. The loop already
knows a module must rebuild when a dependency did (`dependencyRebuilt`) but it
can only act on modules that are IN the batch, and the component never entered
it. So the style rebuilt and the thing rendering it did not.

UB-190 fixed the mirror case - focus ON the style - by seeding the KEEP set with
its importers. That was the special case; this is the rule.

FIX: the candidate set is closed UPWARD over importers before anything is
restricted. Searched over the whole tree rather than over the batch, because the
modules being added are by definition the ones that did not change.

Three reports, three layers, one question asked wrongly: not "what is unsaved",
not "what changed", but "what is no longer valid".

### UB-199 — the canvas ignored a right-click after a create `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-24: create a component from the canvas menu, then right-click
the canvas - nothing. Left-click first, and right-click works.

ROOT CAUSE: the create prompt is an EditorWindow, and it takes focus back on its
way out. Unity leaves the builder VISIBLE but not ACTIVE, and a popup cannot open
from a window that is not the focused one - so the right-click reached the canvas
and the menu it asked for never appeared.

UB-197 already tried to take the keyboard back and lost this race: it CHECKED
whether focus had landed, and a state test cannot see a closing window that has
not taken focus back yet. It re-asserts instead, four times across ~120ms,
stopping early only for a typing target - which means an editor the user has
since moved into.

### UB-200 — a new card still hung below the cursor `FIXED` `LOW`

UB-195 centred a new card horizontally and lifted it a fixed 18px, which is a
title bar's worth. A card is hundreds of pixels tall, so most of it still hung
below the pointer. Centred on both axes now, against the height a fresh template
draws.

### UB-201 — the preview pipeline cannot be debugged from its symptoms `RESOLVED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-24, third round on the same complaint: an edit to a style
module does not reach the preview of the component that imports it.

Three fixes have gone into this pipeline, each correct and each aimed at a real
defect - UB-190 (the focus closure dropped importers), UB-194 (candidates keyed
on unsaved rather than unbuilt), UB-198 (the set was not closed upward over
importers). None of them was the one the owner is hitting.

The reason the guessing continued is that the pipeline's failures are INVISIBLE
and identical from outside: a module missing from the batch, a module that
compiled and produced no change, and a module whose compile silently failed all
look the same in the preview - nothing happens. Reading the code has now produced
three plausible mechanisms and no evidence.

What is RULED OUT by reading: import resolution (`ResolveImports` uses the same
resolver the canvas draws its edges with, and the edge is drawn); the unsaved
buffer overlay (`ReadUitkxText` prefers it, and imported modules are compiled
from it into the same swap assembly); and batch ordering (dependencies before
dependents, with `dependencyRebuilt` for the untouched dependent).

A "Trace" toggle in the toolbar now logs one line per compile round: which
modules were CONSIDERED after the focus closure, which rebuilt and why, which
failed, and which were skipped for a failed dependency. The next report carries
the answer instead of the symptom.

NOT a fix. Left OPEN deliberately.

### UB-202 — the preview was handed the FOCUS's assembly, not the one it renders `FIXED` `HIGH`

Found by the UB-201 trace, first time out, after three wrong guesses:

    preview: focus someNewComponent.style.uitkx
    considered: leftSide.style.uitkx, LeftSide.uitkx, SomeNewComponent.uitkx
    rebuilt:    leftSide.style.uitkx (text changed)
                LeftSide.uitkx (dependency rebuilt)
                SomeNewComponent.uitkx (dependency rebuilt)

Everything rebuilt. Nothing failed, nothing was skipped. So the compile pipeline
was correct - and had been made correct three times over - while the defect sat
one layer downstream, and the trace also named it: the FOCUS is a style module
while the preview is showing a component.

ROOT CAUSE: the pane renders the file IT is showing, but the window handed it the
assembly and the buffer text of `_focusFile`. Clicking a style entry to edit it
moves the focus onto that style, so the pane was asked to render a component out
of the STYLE's assembly with the STYLE's text. It could not, so it kept the last
good render - which looks exactly like "the edit did nothing".

It worked when editing the component's own text because then the focus and the
rendered file are the same, which is why the asymmetry in the reports was real
and kept pointing away from the answer.

FIX: `BuilderPreviewPane.ShownFile`, and the compile anchor, the assembly and the
buffer are all keyed on it. The batch is now built around what is on screen
rather than around what is selected - which also makes UB-190's special case
(seed the keep-set with the focus's importers) belt-and-braces rather than
load-bearing.

LESSON, recorded because it cost four rounds: UB-190, UB-194 and UB-198 were all
real defects and all correctly fixed, and none of them was this. Every one was
reasoned from the code and none from evidence, because the pipeline's failure
modes are indistinguishable from outside. The trace paid for itself on its first
run.

### UB-203 — the preview bound imports to the SAVED copy, never the live buffer `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

The actual cause of four rounds of reports. Style edits never reached the
preview - not staleness, never at all, at any value, which is the detail that
should have redirected the search much earlier: `Px(500)`, `Px(80)`, `ColorBlue`,
`ColorRed` and a `BackgroundColor` all rendered as an unstyled label.

ROOT CAUSE, in `UitkxHmrCompiler`'s swap-unit builder. An imported module's
`__Exports` is inlined into the hot unit only when the container exists in no
referenceable assembly:

    if (!TypeExistsInProjectAssemblies(exportsFqn) && !HotExportsAvailable(...))

That is right for HMR, where the file on disk IS the truth. It is wrong for the
BUILDER, which compiles unsaved buffers under the save-only contract: a style
module saved once and edited ever since always exists in the project assembly, so
it was never inlined and the component bound to the SAVED exports. Every unsaved
edit was invisible by construction.

It explains every observation at once: component text edits render (the
component's own markup IS in the swap unit); style edits never do; removing and
re-adding the import changes nothing; and it would all have worked after a Save,
which was never done because nothing suggested it would matter.

FIX: an OVERLAID companion - one the caller holds a live buffer for - is inlined
regardless of the gate, because the project assembly's copy is then stale by
construction. Only the builder sets `SourceOverlay`; the HMR controller's own
instance leaves it null and keeps the original gate, so the change cannot reach
HMR.

The compiler also gained a `Trace` sink reporting what each swap unit inlines.
That fact decides whether an edit to an imported module can be seen at all, and
it was invisible from outside - which is what made this take four rounds.

WRONG TURNS, recorded so the next reader does not repeat them: UB-190, UB-194 and
UB-198 were each a real defect in the compile BATCH, each correctly fixed, and
none of them this. UB-202 (the pane was handed the focus's assembly rather than
the rendered file's) was also real and also not this. Four fixes, one bug, and
the tell was there from the first report - "never applies" is a different
question from "applies late".

### UB-204 — saving a folder rearrangement failed on the destination `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-24, first real use of the folder view: rearrange, Save, and

    could not move .../LeftSide/leftSide.style.uitkx to .../components/LeftSide/...
    Could not find parent directory GUID:00000000000000000000000000000000

ROOT CAUSE: `EnsureDirectory` created the destination with
`Directory.CreateDirectory`, which puts a folder on the FILESYSTEM.
`AssetDatabase.MoveAsset` resolves the destination's parent by GUID, and a folder
Unity has never imported has none. So the first module re-filed into a folder
that did not exist yet failed the whole save - and the folder view makes moving
into a new folder the ordinary case.

FIX: inside the project, destination folders are created THROUGH the
AssetDatabase, ancestors first, so each gets a GUID. A folder already on disk
without one - what an earlier part-way save leaves behind - is imported rather
than created again, which would have put a "Folder 1" beside it. Outside
Assets/ and Packages/ there is no asset database to tell, and the plain
directory create stands.

ALSO FIXED, because the same save exposes it: a move now takes the folder it
EMPTIED with it, and that folder's parents while they are empty too. A move that
leaves the old folder standing has not moved anything as far as the Project
window is concerned. A folder holding anything else stays - a .cs beside a
component, a .uss, a texture - and only .meta files are ignored, since a .meta is
not content, it is Unity's note about content that is no longer there.

### UB-205 — a parent renders its children from the SAVED assembly `OPEN` `HIGH`

Owner question 2026-08-24, and it is a defect, not a misreading: with all three
children emptied to a bare `<VisualElement />`, focusing each child previews
nothing - correctly - while focusing the PARENT still shows "Right Side" and
"Left side". Three things that render nothing cannot compose into something.

This is UB-203's sibling one level up. An imported STYLE module is now inlined
into the parent's hot unit when the builder holds a live buffer for it; an
imported COMPONENT deliberately never is - component types resolve through the
Family registry instead, so a rebuilt child reaches every consumer regardless of
which DLL generation baked it.

RULED OUT by reading: the families ARE registered - `ForceRunModuleInitializers`
runs on both load paths, precisely so a synthetic companion type carrying
`[ModuleInitializer]` cannot be skipped for never being touched.

REMAINING SUSPECT: the family KEY. The consumer bakes `__fam_<FQN>` from the
child FQN as the PARENT sees it, and the child registers under
`effectiveNs + "." + componentName` computed from ITS OWN path. Both are derived
from file paths, and namespaces here are FILE-KEYED - so a moved or renamed child
can register under one key while its parent looks up another. On a miss the
consumer falls back to `childFqn.Render`, which is the SAVED assembly's body:
a stale render that reports no error anywhere. The owner had just rearranged
folders, which is exactly the operation that changes those paths.

The Trace now reports the family key each build registers under, so a
producer/consumer mismatch is readable instead of inferred.

NOT fixed. Left OPEN rather than guessed at - four rounds on UB-203 were spent
shipping mechanisms that read correctly and were not the cause.

### UB-206 — Save wrote a 0-byte module and broke the project's compile `FIXED` `CRITICAL`

Owner report 2026-08-24: saved, and the project stopped compiling with

    componentTwo.style.uitkx(1,8): CS1029 #error: does not contain a valid
      top-level declaration
    ComponentTwo.uitkx(4,8): CS1029 #error: unused import `ComponentTwoStyle`

The save itself was correct - 5 files, the nesting right, the provisional folder
cleaned up. `componentTwo.style.uitkx` was written at 0 bytes because the BUFFER
was empty, and the same UITKX2105 appears in the trace BEFORE the save, at the
provisional path, so it was empty well before Save touched it.

A style module starts empty by design (`TemplateFor` returns "" for Style and
Utils - exports arrive via "+ style"), so emptiness is a legitimate state while
editing. Writing it is not: the language requires a top-level declaration, so an
empty .uitkx is not an empty file, it is a BROKEN one, and it takes the whole
project's compile with it.

FIX, at the point of decision. Save now settles empty modules before writing
anything: it names them and offers delete / cancel / save anyway. Deleting goes
through the same path as any other deletion, so the references go with it - which
is what would have prevented the second error too.

ALSO: "Delete style X" on a module's LAST export now offers to delete the MODULE
instead of the lines. Removing the last export is how a module gets emptied in
the first place, and at that point the module is what the user means to be rid
of, not a file that stops the project compiling.

The owner's project was repaired by hand: the 0-byte file removed and the now
unused import stripped from ComponentTwo.

NOT ESTABLISHED: which gesture emptied the buffer. The card still showed the
export while the buffer was empty, so a canvas node outlived its module's text -
worth watching, but the guard above is correct whatever the route, and it catches
routes nobody has thought of yet.

### UB-207 — three components in a row nested three deep `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-25, traced through the code together: open a new builder,
right-click the canvas three times to create three components, and get

    First/components/A/components/B/components/C/

instead of three siblings. The structure recorded the ORDER OF THE CLICKS.

ROOT CAUSE: UB-187 placed a new module relative to the FOCUS, and creating one
moves the focus onto it - so each create nested under the previous. A canvas
right-click carries world coordinates and nothing else; it says "put a component
in this tree", never "put one under X", so taking the focus as a parent invented
a relationship the gesture never stated.

FIX, and the rule the whole design now rests on: CREATE STATES PLACEMENT, WIRING
STATES USAGE.

- Canvas right-click creates at the tree ROOT. A companion still joins a
  component whose family name it matches (UB-187), kept as this path's fallback.
- Right-click a COMPONENT card, "Create in X...": a component becomes a child at
  `X/components/New/`, a style, hook or util a sibling at `X/`. The prompt names
  the parent, and the new card lands under X on the canvas. Companion cards do
  not offer it - a style module has no children.
- Nothing is auto-imported. Considered and rejected: an import with no usage is
  `UITKX2304`, ERROR-tier since 0.9.1, so the project stops compiling on the next
  Save; and adding a usage means guessing which element a style was meant for.
  Wiring is a separate gesture and it is the one that knows.

Also rejected, after being designed: a module CLIMBING to the closest shared
parent of its importers as more things use it. Elegant, and unpredictable in a
deep tree - a file moving because something elsewhere started using it.

Companions as siblings is also what lets `Card/button.style.uitkx` and
`Panel/button.style.uitkx` coexist, which the old root-only rule forbade.

### UB-208 — the folder tree was a canvas mode `SHIPPED` `MED`

Owner ask 2026-08-25. Seeing where modules live is something you do WHILE working
on the canvas, not instead of it, so the tree moved to the LEFT panel above the
library - fixed height, expanded by default, foldable for when the library needs
the room. The "Folders" toolbar button and the centre-pane swap are gone.

The standing hint went with it: three lines of instructions is most of a 200px
column, so the gestures ride on the rows as tooltips.

### UB-209 — a popup needs its window ACTIVE, and chasing that with a timer lost `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-26, the third time this symptom has come back: create a
child component, then right-click - nothing happens.

A right-click reaches its element whatever Unity considers focused, but a POPUP
cannot open from a window that is not the active one. UB-197 and UB-199 both
chased it after the fact with a timer that re-asserted focus, and a timer loses
to anything slower than it guessed.

FIX at the point of decision: a menu focuses its invoking window synchronously,
in `BuilderSearchMenu`, immediately before it opens. Nothing has to be timed.

### UB-210 — a menu that opens another menu reads as a mistake `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-26: "the context menu opening another context menu is very
confusing and annoying."

The card menu's "Create in X..." opened a second popup on top of the first. The
four create rows are now IN the card menu, labelled with what they do - "New
component (child of X)", "New style module (beside X)". Four rows cost less than
the ceremony of hiding them behind one.

SUPERSEDED the same day: the owner rejected flattening - "we can shove 30
options eventually there" - and was right. See UB-214.

### UB-211 — two components could share a name `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-26: with NewComponent selected, created another
NewComponent, and it was allowed - landing at
`NewComponent/components/NewComponent/`.

The name check asked whether the PATH was free, and it was. But a component's
name is a name in the whole TREE: both export `NewComponent`, so every import of
it is ambiguous, the library lists it twice and the canvas draws two identical
cards. Component names are now checked against every component in the tree,
whatever folder it sits in.

### UB-212 — children stacked on one another `FIXED` `LOW`

A second child created from the same parent landed on top of the first. Children
of one parent belong side by side: the first free slot along the row is taken, so
a second and third land beside the first however the row was arranged.

### UB-213 — a layer dropped at the first notch of zoom-out `FIXED` `LOW`

Owner ask 2026-08-26: more room to zoom out before a layer gives way. The LOD
boundaries moved down - 0.45 to 0.32 and 1.05 to 0.80 - so reading a card at Edit
detail and pulling back for context no longer costs the detail immediately. The
toolbar presets still land one per layer.

### UB-214 — submenus, without the focus fight `SHIPPED` `MED`

Owner, rejecting the flattening in UB-210: "no i dont like that, submenus, find a
way. its a needed feature anyway, flattening is bad we can shove 30 options
eventually there." Correct - the create kinds will not stay at four.

The obstacle was real: every menu here is an EditorWindow that closes on lost
focus, so a child POPUP taking focus closes its own parent. The way around it is
to stop making the submenu a window. `Item.Children` opens a SECOND COLUMN inside
the same window - one window cannot fight itself for focus.

- Hovering a parent row opens its column; hovering any other row of the LEFT
  column closes it. Moving the pointer into the column itself is neither, so the
  submenu survives the trip across.
- Clicking a parent opens it too, for anyone who clicks rather than hovers.
- Right arrow steps the keyboard in, Left steps out, Enter on a parent opens it.
- The window is sized for both columns UP FRONT: growing it on hover would move
  the rows out from under the pointer that opened them.

The card menu is back to one "New" row with the four kinds behind it, and any
menu can nest now by filling in `Children`.

### UB-215 — two menu types, each doing what it is good at `SHIPPED` `MED`

Owner, after seeing UB-214's two-column popup: "you basically made the menu much
bigger so you can fit the submenu in?" Yes - and it was the wrong shape. A popup
cannot resize without pulling rows out from under the pointer, so the window was
sized for both columns from the start and sat there half empty.

Researched what Unity actually offers:

- **GenericMenu** - the editor's own context menu. Submenus are just a PATH:
  `AddItem(new GUIContent("New/Component"), ...)` draws a real flyout with the
  editor's hover and keyboard. And it is not an EditorWindow popup, so the
  open-from-an-inactive-window rule that cost three fixes (UB-197, UB-199,
  UB-209) does not apply to it at all.
- **AdvancedDropdown** - searchable AND hierarchical, the Add Component control.
  Rejected: it selects from a FIXED item tree, and 4 of the 8 searchable menus
  need a freeform "use what I typed" row, which it cannot express. Its sizing is
  also awkward (`minimumSize` protected, `maximumSize` internal).

SO: the 7 non-searchable menus are GenericMenu now, and the custom window keeps
the 8 searchable menus and 5 name prompts, where freeform entry and the inline
error line are load-bearing. The hand-rolled submenu column is deleted.

Deliberate cost: context menus look like Unity rather than like the POC's dark
`.ctx` chrome. Correct submenu, hover and focus behaviour beat matching the mock.

`FocusInvoker` moved into `Place`, so every remaining custom window takes the
keyboard before it opens rather than only the plain menus doing so.

### UB-216 — the context menu, fourth shape and the right one `SHIPPED` `MED`

Three shapes failed on the same structural point before this one, and each
failure was informative:

1. A custom **EditorWindow** (the original) cannot have a submenu: the submenu is
   a SECOND EditorWindow, each closes on lost focus, so the child kills its
   parent.
2. **One window sized for two columns** (UB-214) dodged the fight and left a
   permanently oversized menu with a hidden half - the owner saw through it
   immediately: "you basically made the menu much bigger so you can fit the
   submenu in?"
3. **IMGUI GenericMenu** (UB-215) has real submenus and correct focus, and cannot
   be styled AT ALL - no GUIStyle hook, no skin override, confirmed against the
   docs. It could not match the rest of the builder.

UI Toolkit's **GenericDropdownMenu** pointed at the answer without being it. Its
`DropDown()` does `m_PanelRootVisualContainer.Add(m_MenuContainer)` - the menu is
a LAYER IN THE PANEL, not a window, so nothing can lose focus to anything. But
its rows come from `AddItem`, which offers no hook to open a submenu and no
public way to dismiss the menu from a row of one's own, so a submenu cannot be
built on it either. Its submenu support was also claimed by a search summary and
is not in the source or the 6000.3 docs.

The lifecycle it owns is thirty lines: cover the panel, close on an outside click
or Escape. `BuilderContextMenu` owns those thirty lines instead and inherits no
limits - the styling is the builder's, and a submenu is a real flyout positioned
beside its row, parented to the full-panel scrim so the menu box cannot clip it.

Rejected: the third-party UnityDropdown, which does all of this and a search bar.
It requires disabling Assembly Version Validation in Player Settings, which is
not something a UI library should ask of everyone who installs this package.

The searchable menus and name prompts stay in the EditorWindow, where a search
field, a freeform "use what I typed" row and an inline error line are what it
exists for.

### UB-217 — the context menu had no keyboard `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-26: up/down/Enter do nothing, and Escape does nothing
either.

Escape was WIRED, on the menu's own scrim, and could never have fired: a
KeyDownEvent goes to the FOCUSED element and bubbles through ITS ancestors, and
the menu is not one of them. Focusing the scrim would have worked only while
nothing else wanted focus. The handler now sits on the panel ROOT with
TrickleDown, so the menu gets first refusal on a key wherever focus happens to
be, and comes off again when the menu closes.

The arrows and Enter were simply never built - the menu shipped pointer-only.
Down/Up walk the column the eye is on, Right steps into a flyout, Left steps back
out, Enter picks (or opens, on a nesting row), and Escape backs out one level at
a time rather than closing everything at once.

### UB-218 — the menu title read as an instruction `FIXED` `LOW`

Owner report 2026-08-26: the title is "not always true".

A card menu was headed with the card's TITLE, so a component called NewComponent
produced a menu headed "NEWCOMPONENT" directly above a row reading "New" - which
reads as announcing a new component rather than naming the card being acted on.
It is only ambiguous for that name, which is exactly why it was easy to miss.

The heading is the FILE now - "NewComponent.uitkx" - which cannot be read as an
instruction. The flyout also carries its own heading, since the menu's title sits
above it visually and looked like a heading for its rows.

### UB-220 — Save rearranged the canvas `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-08-26: "i had the component sorted in 1 way in the canvas,
when i clicked save, it switch twice and not small change it completely
rearrange how it looks".

EVIDENCE, not inference. `UserSettings/ReactiveUIToolkit/Builder/` held TWO
configs written seconds apart by that one save - which is the "twice" - and the
first one carried the whole story in its own Positions table:

```
NewComponent.uitkx                                    -> [-36.95, -81.05]   the user position, kept
.../__RuitkBuilderUnsaved__~/.../newComponent.style   -> [477.0, -49.8]     orphaned
.../__RuitkBuilderUnsaved__~/.../RightSide.uitkx      -> [651.9, 345.8]     orphaned
.../__RuitkBuilderUnsaved__~/.../MiddleSide.uitkx     -> [210.6, 355.8]     orphaned
.../__RuitkBuilderUnsaved__~/.../LeftSide.uitkx       -> [-235.1, 353.4]    orphaned
components/LeftSide/LeftSide.uitkx                    -> [60, 80]           default column
components/MiddleSide/MiddleSide.uitkx                -> [60, 339.9]        default column
components/RightSide/RightSide.uitkx                  -> [60, 599.8]        default column
newComponent.style.uitkx                              -> [60, 859.7]        default column
```

Exactly one card kept its place and the other four were stacked in a column at
x=60. Their real positions were still in the file, keyed to where they used to
live.

ROOT CAUSE: the placement pass relocates a module by moving its FOLDER, and
that carries every module inside it. The loop told the layout about each move
by reading `module.FilePath` before and after its own `PlaceAt` call - but a
module its parent already carried has ALREADY changed path by the time the loop
reaches it, so before and after are the same string and `Repath` early-returns
on `from == to`. Only the module that physically triggered each move was ever
told. Everything that rode along kept a key under the provisional root, stopped
resolving at the next mount, and `AdoptUnplaced` then wrote the default slot
down - which is what made it permanent rather than a bad first paint.

The shape is the campaign's recurring one: the question asked was "what did
this call move", when the layout needed "what moved". FIX: snapshot where every
module sits before the pass, and reconcile against it afterwards, so passengers
and drivers are both answered and order stops mattering.

### UB-221 — a re-rooted tree looked like a tree nobody had laid out `FIXED` `MED`

The second config from the same save (the second "switch"). It was minted fresh
under a DIFFERENT root - `components/LeftSide/LeftSide.uitkx` rather than
`NewComponent.uitkx` - and filled with a fresh default column for all five
cards.

ROOT CAUSE: the layout is addressed by the tree ROOT, and the root is DERIVED -
from where the modules sit and which of them owns the top folder. It is
therefore not a stable name for a tree: a save that re-files a folder, or a
mount that comes up focused elsewhere, can elect a different head, and the
lookup then misses entirely. The fallback scan asked only whether one file - the
FOCUS - appeared in some config's member list, which is the same fragile
question narrowed to a single member.

FIX: identify a tree by WHO IS IN IT. `LoadForMembers` returns the config
sharing the most members with the graph, newest breaking a tie, so a re-rooted
tree finds its own layout instead of minting a default one. `LoadForMember` is
removed rather than left beside it - two lookups that can disagree is how this
went wrong once already.

RECOVERY: the owner's four displaced cards were put back by re-keying the
orphaned entries onto the saved tree (their coordinates were never lost, only
unaddressable) and the duplicate config deleted. Backup in
`UserSettings/ReactiveUIToolkit/Builder/.backup-ub220/`.

### UB-227/228/229 — a saved style edit rendered the PREVIOUS colour `FIXED` `HIGH`

Owner report 2026-09-05: edit a style entry, the preview shows the new colour,
then it reverts. With HMR stopped the preview held; with HMR running, Save put
the old colour back about two seconds later. The card and the source pane kept
the NEW value throughout, so this was never an edit being rolled back.

Three independent defects wearing one symptom. Each was found only after the
compile path was instrumented end to end - what was read, what was emitted, what
the built assembly actually held, and what the swap wrote where.

**UB-227 — the union dropped the inlined companion.** `ComponentBuildArtifacts`
tracked inlined companions in two collections: the sources came from the
emitter's import-target discovery, the paths from a separate same-stem sibling
scan. Those answer different questions - an IMPORTED module is inlined but is
not a name-prefixed sibling - so a component whose only companion was an import
produced one source and ZERO paths. The batch guarded on
`Sources.Count > 0 && Paths.Count > 0`, so the whole block was skipped and every
inlined companion vanished from the union with nothing logged. The component
bound to whatever `__Exports` was already loaded. The single-file path has no
such guard, which is exactly why the first round rendered correctly and the
split-assembly rebuild that followed did not.

FIX: one collection of (path, source) pairs, filled by the emitter as it
inlines. The parallel scan, the positional zip and its "defensive fallback if
the order assumption above is off" all went with it.

**UB-228 — the module-static swap wrote to the wrong copy.**
`SwapModuleStatics` copies a fresh module static onto the project-loaded type,
but `FindProjectType` returned the FIRST assembly in app-domain order with a
matching name. A session accumulates many copies of one `__Exports`: one per hot
style compile, plus the copy the builder inlines into every component unit. So
the new value landed on an arbitrary hot copy while the project type - the one
the recompiled importer binds to - kept the old one. It counted as a success and
logged `Module statics re-init: 1`.

FIX: skip `hmr_`-prefixed assemblies, the same test the compiler already uses in
three other places to exclude its own output.

**UB-229 — the real one.** Read, emit and compile were all verified correct: the
save wrote 198 bytes, the watcher dispatched 198 bytes, the compiler read 198
bytes, and the emitted C# said `BackgroundColor = ColorRed`. The freshly loaded
assembly held grey.

ROOT CAUSE: each hot compile writes `hmr_{name}_{n}.dll` to a FIXED temp
directory and loads it with `Assembly.LoadFrom`, which returns an ALREADY-LOADED
assembly of the same identity and ignores the new bytes on disk. An assembly can
never be unloaded. `_swapCounter` was per-instance and zeroed by `Reset()`, which
runs on every HMR stop/start - so each restart replayed 1, 2, 3... and the first
compiles after a restart resolved to the previous session's assemblies.

It reproduced every time only because the owner was restarting HMR between
attempts. The builder's own compiler instance is never `Reset()`, so its counter
kept climbing and never collided - which is why "it works with HMR off" was true
and misleading.

FIX: the counter is static and never reset. Static also removes a latent
collision between the builder's compiler instance and HMR's, which had separate
counters over one shared temp directory.

LESSON: three of these are the same shape - two mechanisms that must agree about
one fact, kept in separate places. Sources vs paths, the swap's target vs the
importer's binding, the assembly name vs the assembly identity. None of the
three failed loudly.

TEST DEBT: none of the three is covered. Nothing under `Editor/HMR/` is
reachable from either suite (the Editor asmdef pulls in `UnityEditor`), which is
also why they survived this long. Tracked as RT-BLD in `Plans~/REMAINING_WORK.md`.

### UB-219 — the window ate the menu's Escape `FIXED` `MED`

Owner report 2026-08-26, after UB-217: arrows and Enter work, Escape still does
nothing. That asymmetry IS the diagnosis - the menu's key handler is clearly
firing, so something takes Escape specifically before it.

ROOT CAUSE: `BuilderWindow` registers its own KeyDownEvent on
`rootVisualElement` with TrickleDown, at CreateGUI - before the menu registers
one on the SAME element. Same element, same phase, so registration order decides,
and the window goes first. Its Escape branch calls `CancelActiveEdit()` and then
`ConsumeKey`, which uses `StopImmediatePropagation` - and that kills the
remaining callbacks on that element too, not just the rest of the propagation
path. The arrows worked because the window's switch ignores them and returns
without consuming.

FIX: a menu is the innermost thing on screen, so Escape belongs to it. The window
defers while one is open, and the menu's own handler keeps doing the backing-out
one level at a time. One place owns menu Escape.

Worth remembering generally: `StopImmediatePropagation` on a shared element is
invisible to whoever registers later, and the two handlers never appear in the
same file.
